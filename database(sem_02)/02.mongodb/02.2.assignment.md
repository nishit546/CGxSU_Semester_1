# **MongoDB Core Concepts – Assignment & Practice**

This assignment is designed to check your **conceptual understanding** of MongoDB core concepts before you start writing CRUD commands.
No coding is required yet. Focus on **clarity and correctness**.

---

## **Assignment 1: Core Understanding**

Answer each question in **2–4 lines**.

1. What problem does MongoDB’s document-based model solve compared to relational databases?
2. Explain the MongoDB data hierarchy in the correct order.
3. Why are collections in MongoDB more flexible than tables in relational databases?
4. What is a document in MongoDB, and why is it considered a complete unit of data?

---

## **Assignment 2: Database, Collection, Document**

Based on the article, answer the following:

1. What is the role of a database in MongoDB?
2. What kind of data should ideally go into a single collection?
3. Can documents inside the same collection have different fields? Why is this useful?

---

## **Assignment 3: BSON Concepts**

Answer briefly:

1. What is BSON?
2. Why does MongoDB use BSON instead of plain JSON?
3. Name **any three** BSON-supported data types that JSON does not handle well.
4. Why is storing dates as real date types better than strings?

---

## **Assignment 4: Schema-less Design**

Answer the following:

1. What does “schema-less” mean in MongoDB?
2. Does schema-less mean no structure? Explain.
3. How does schema-less design help when application requirements change?

---

## **Assignment 5: Embedding vs Referencing (Very Important)**

Answer clearly:

1. What is embedding in MongoDB?
2. What is referencing in MongoDB?
3. Mention **two advantages** of embedding.
4. Mention **two advantages** of referencing.

---

## **Assignment 6: Choose the Right Approach**

For each scenario, write **Embed** or **Reference**, and explain **why**.

1. An order and its items
2. A user and their profile address
3. Courses shared by thousands of students
4. Products reused across many orders

---

## **Assignment 7: Rule of Thumb**

Answer in one or two lines:

1. What is the simple rule of thumb for choosing between embedding and referencing?
2. Why is document size an important consideration in MongoDB schema design?

---

## **Assignment 8: Self-Check (Mandatory)**

Without looking at notes, try to explain:

* Database vs collection vs document
* BSON vs JSON
* Schema-less design
* Embedding vs referencing

If you struggle, re-read the article before moving ahead.

---

## **Completion Criteria**

You are ready to move forward if you can:

* Explain MongoDB core concepts confidently
* Choose embedding or referencing correctly for simple scenarios
* Understand why MongoDB schema design is different from SQL
