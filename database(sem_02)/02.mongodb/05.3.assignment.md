# **Assignment – Reading Documents in MongoDB (Query Practice Set 2)**

**Focus: `find()` and `findOne()` only**

---

## **Part A – Insert Practice Data (One Time Only)**

Use this dataset **once** before starting queries.

```javascript
use jobs
```

```javascript
db.jobs.insertMany([
  {
    company: "Google",
    role: "Software Engineer",
    experienceRequired: 2,
    skills: ["DSA", "System Design", "Java"],
    location: "Bangalore",
    isRemote: false
  },
  {
    company: "Amazon",
    role: "Backend Developer",
    experienceRequired: 3,
    skills: ["Node.js", "MongoDB", "AWS"],
    location: "Hyderabad",
    isRemote: false
  },
  {
    company: "Flipkart",
    role: "Full Stack Developer",
    experienceRequired: 1,
    skills: ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB"],
    location: "Remote",
    isRemote: true
  },
  {
    company: "Microsoft",
    role: "Software Engineer",
    experienceRequired: 2,
    skills: ["C++", "DSA", "System Design"],
    location: "Bangalore",
    isRemote: false
  },
  {
    company: "Swiggy",
    role: "Backend Developer",
    experienceRequired: 1,
    skills: ["Node.js", "Express", "MongoDB"],
    location: "Remote",
    isRemote: true
  }
]);
```

## **Part B – Basic Query Tasks**

Write MongoDB queries for each task.

1. Fetch **all job postings**
2. Fetch all jobs where the role is **Backend Developer**
3. Fetch all jobs located in **Bangalore**
4. Fetch all **remote jobs**
5. Fetch jobs where experience required is **1 year**

---

## **Part C – Array Field Queries**

6. Fetch jobs that require **MongoDB**
7. Fetch jobs that require **Node.js**
8. Fetch jobs that require **System Design**

*(Do not use operators yet)*

---

## **Part D – Using `findOne()`**

9. Fetch **one job** from **Google**
10. Fetch **one job** where the company is **Swiggy**

Answer briefly:

* Why is `findOne()` acceptable here?
* Would `find()` also work?

---

## **Part E – Case & Data-Type Checks**

11. Run both queries and observe results:

```javascript
db.jobs.find({ location: "remote" })
db.jobs.find({ location: "Remote" })
```

12. Run:

```javascript
db.jobs.find({ experienceRequired: "2" })
db.jobs.find({ experienceRequired: 2 })
```

Answer:

* Which queries return results?
* Why?

---

## **Part F – Thinking Queries (No Operators)**

13. Fetch jobs where the role is **Software Engineer**

---

## **Expected Skill After This Assignment**

After completing this assignment, students should be able to:

* Read documents confidently using filters
* Query array fields correctly
* Understand case sensitivity
* Identify data type mismatches
* Choose between `find()` and `findOne()` intentionally
