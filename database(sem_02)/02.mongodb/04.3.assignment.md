# **Assignment – Creating Documents in MongoDB (Practice Set 02)**

This is the **second practice assignment** for MongoDB *Create* operations.

This assignment focuses on:

* repetition through **different domains**
* strengthening confidence with `insertOne()` and `insertMany()`
* avoiding silent data design mistakes

---

## **Part A – insertOne() (User Accounts Example)**

Create a collection named:

```
users
```

### Task 1

Insert **three user documents** using **three separate `insertOne()` commands**.

Each document must include:

* `username` (string)
* `email` (string)
* `isActive` (boolean)
* `roles` (array)
* `createdAt` (use `new Date()`)

### Rules

* Do **not** manually set `_id`
* Use **consistent field names**
* Each user must have **different roles**

---

## **Part B – insertMany() (App Logs Example)**

Create a collection named:

```
logs
```

### Task 2

Insert **five log documents at once** using **one `insertMany()` command**.

Each document must include:

* `level` (string – info / warning / error)
* `message` (string)
* `timestamp` (use `new Date()`)

At least **one log** must include:

* `source` (string)

---

## **Part C – insertOne() (Company Job Post Example)**

Create a collection named:

```
job_posts
```

### Task 3

Insert **two job posts** using **two separate `insertOne()` commands**.

Each document must include:

* `companyName` (string)
* `role` (string)
* `experienceRequired` (number)
* `skillsRequired` (array)
* `postedOn` (use `new Date()`)

---

## **Part D – insertMany() (Batch Job Posting Example)**

### Task 4

Insert **four job posts at once** using **one `insertMany()` command**.

Rules:

* All posts must be for the **same company**
* Each post must have a **different role**
* At least one post must include:

  * `salaryRange`

---

## **Part E – Observation Questions**

Answer briefly:

1. Which tasks were better suited for `insertOne()` and why?
2. Which tasks required `insertMany()` and why?
3. What happens if one document in `insertMany()` is invalid?

---

## **Part F – Spot the Problem**

Identify issues in the following document:

```json
{
  "company": "TestCorp",
  "experience": "3",
  "skills": "MongoDB",
  "_id": 100
}
```

### Tasks

1. List at least **three problems**
2. Rewrite the document correctly

---

## **Expected Outcome After Assignment 02**

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* switch confidently between collections
* choose between `insertOne()` and `insertMany()`
* design cleaner MongoDB documents
* recognize risky insert patterns
