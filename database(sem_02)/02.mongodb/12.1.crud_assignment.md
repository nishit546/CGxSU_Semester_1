## **SECTION 0 – Database Setup & Initial Data (Given)**

### **Q1. Switch to a New Database**

```javascript

    studentId: "CG-STU-001",
    name: "Arjun",
    age: 21,
    year: 3,
    department: "CSE",
    skills: ["C", "C++", "DSA"],
    isActive: true
  },
  {
    studentId: "CG-STU-002",
    name: "Mahir",
    age: 20,
    year: 2,
    department: "CSE",
    skills: ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"],
