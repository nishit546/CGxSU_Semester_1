## Projections, Sorting & Pagination

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mandatory Instructions (Must Be Followed)**
> These instructions are strictly mandatory and reflect standard backend lab practices.

###  Data Source

*   All questions must be solved using the provided dataset only.
*   **Data File:** `restaurants.json`
*   **Database Name:** `foodDB`
*   **Collection Name:** `restaurants`

> [!WARNING]
> **Strict Prohibitions**
> *   Creating new data is **strictly prohibited**.
> *   Modifying existing documents is **not allowed**.
> *   Inserting additional records is **not permitted**.
> *   Any change in database or collection name will be treated as incorrect.

###  Restricted Operations
The following operations are **updated** allowed:
*   Insert operations
*   Update operations
*   Delete operations
*   Aggregation pipeline

###  Allowed Operations
*   Only the `find()` method is allowed.
*   Only MongoDB operators taught in class may be used.
*   Results must be controlled using:
    *   **Projections**
    *   **Sorting**
    *   **Pagination** (`skip` and `limit`) where required

###  Execution & Verification Rules
1.  Every solution must be executed in Mongo Shell (`mongosh`) first.
2.  Output must be checked carefully:
    *   The result should match the condition mentioned in the question.
3.  If the output is incorrect:
    *   Correct it and test again.
    *   Only verified solutions should be written on paper.
4.  Directly writing answers on paper without testing is not acceptable.
5.  Paper answers must exactly match the verified Mongo Shell version.
