# 📘 MongoDB Practical Assignment
## Projections, Sorting & Pagination

###  Mandatory Instructions (Must Be Followed)

These instructions are strictly mandatory and reflect standard backend lab practices.

####  Data Source

* All questions must be solved using the provided dataset only.
* **Data File:** `restaurants.json`
* Creating new data is strictly prohibited.
* Modifying existing documents is not allowed.
* Inserting additional records into the collection is not permitted.

####  Database Configuration (Fixed)

Students must work with the following configuration only:

* **Database Name:** `foodDB`
* **Collection Name:** `restaurants`
* **Dataset:** `restaurants.json`
* Any change in database or collection name will be treated as incorrect.

#### 🚫 Restricted Operations

The following operations are not allowed:

* Insert operations
* Update operations
* Delete operations
* Aggregation pipeline

#### ✅ Allowed Operations

* Only the `find()` method is allowed.
* Only MongoDB operators taught in class may be used.
* Results must be controlled using:
  * projections
  * sorting
  * pagination (`skip` and `limit`) where required

###  Execution & Verification Rules

* Every solution must be executed in Mongo Shell (`mongosh`) first.
* Output must be checked carefully:
  * The result should match the condition mentioned in the question.
* If the output is incorrect:
  * Correct it and test again.
  * Only verified solutions should be written on paper.
* Directly writing answers on paper without testing is not acceptable.
* Paper answers must exactly match the verified Mongo Shell version.

### 📘 Dataset Structure (Reference)
```json
{
  "URL": "http://www.just-eat.co.uk/restaurants-cn-chinese-cardiff/menu",
  "address": "228 City Road",
  "address line 2": "Cardiff",
  "name": ".CN Chinese",
  "outcode": "CF24",
  "postcode": "3JH",
  "rating": 5,
  "type_of_food": "Chinese"
}
```

###  LEVEL 1 – PROJECTIONS (Q1–Q10)

* **Q1.** Write query to find all restaurant names only.
* **Q2.** Write query to find restaurant name and rating only, excluding `_id`.
* **Q3.** Write query to find all restaurants except the `URL` field.
* **Q4.** Write query to find `name`, `type_of_food`, and `postcode` only.
* **Q5.** Write query to find all fields except `address` and `address line 2`.
* **Q6.** Write query to find Chinese restaurants showing `name` and `rating` only.
* **Q7.** Write query to find Thai restaurants showing `name` and `outcode` only.
* **Q8.** Write query to find Pizza restaurants showing `name`, `rating`, and `postcode`.
* **Q9.** Write query to find restaurants with `rating` equal to 5 showing `name` and `type_of_food`.
* **Q10.** Write query to find restaurants that are not yet rated showing `name` and `type_of_food`.

###  LEVEL 2 – SORTING (Q11–Q20)

* **Q11.** Write query to find restaurants sorted by `rating` from high to low.
* **Q12.** Write query to find restaurants sorted by `rating` from low to high.
* **Q13.** Write query to find restaurants sorted by `type_of_food` and then by `rating`.
* **Q14.** Write query to find Pizza restaurants sorted by `rating` (highest first).
* **Q15.** Write query to find Curry restaurants sorted alphabetically by `name`.
* **Q16.** Write query to find Chinese restaurants sorted by `rating`.
* **Q17.** Write query to find restaurants sorted by `postcode`.
* **Q18.** Write query to find Thai restaurants sorted by `rating`.
* **Q19.** Write query to find restaurants sorted alphabetically by `name`.
* **Q20.** Write query to find restaurants sorted by `outcode` and `rating`.

###  LEVEL 3 – PAGINATION (Q21–Q30)

* **Q21.** Write query to find the first 10 restaurants.
* **Q22.** Write query to find the next 10 restaurants (page 2).
* **Q23.** Write query to find the third set of 10 restaurants.
* **Q24.** Write query to find page 5 with 20 restaurants per page.
* **Q25.** Write query to find the first 15 restaurants sorted by `rating`.
* **Q26.** Write query to find the next 15 restaurants sorted by `rating`.
* **Q27.** Write query to find page 3 with 5 restaurants sorted by `name`.
* **Q28.** Write query to find the first 10 Pizza restaurants.
* **Q29.** Write query to find the second page of Pizza restaurants (5 per page).
* **Q30.** Write query to find the top 10 highest-rated restaurants.

###  Learning Outcome

After completing this assignment, students should be able to:

* Use projections to control returned fields
* Apply sorting for meaningful ordering
* Implement pagination using `skip` and `limit`
* Read large MongoDB collections efficiently
