# Practice Test - 1

1. Write a C program to input a float number and check if it is even or odd. Convert the float to an integer using type casting and use if-else to determine the result.

2. Write a C program to input a float number and use if-else to check if it is positive, negative, or zero. Display the result with two decimal places.

3. Write a C program to input a float value representing a student's marks (0 to 100). Convert it to an integer using type casting and use if-else-if to assign grades: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

4. Write a C program to input one integer and one float number. Use type casting to compare them and print which one is larger or if they are equal using if-else.

5. Write a C program to input three float values representing the sides of a triangle. Convert them to integers using type casting and use if-else-if to determine if the triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene. Also, check if the sides can form a valid triangle.

6. Write a C program to input one integer, one float, and one character ('+', '-', '*', '/'). Use type casting to perform the selected arithmetic operation between the integer and float, and use if-else-if to handle the operation. Display the result as a double.
