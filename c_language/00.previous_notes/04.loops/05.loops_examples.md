# Loops in C

In the previous section, we learned what loops are and why we use them. Now let’s take one simple problem and solve it using all three types of loops: **for loop, while loop, and do…while loop**.

### Problem: Print numbers from 1 to 5

We will solve this problem three times using different loops.

---

### Example Code: Printing Numbers 1 to 5 Using All Loops

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i;

    // Using for loop
    printf("Using for loop:\n");
    for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }

    // Using while loop
    printf("\nUsing while loop:\n");
    i = 1; // reset i
    while (i <= 5) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    }

    // Using do...while loop
    printf("\nUsing do...while loop:\n");
    i = 1; // reset i again
    do {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    } while (i <= 5);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Output:

```
Using for loop:
1
2
3
4
5

Using while loop:
1
2
3
4
5

Using do...while loop:
1
2
3
4
5
```

---

### Explanation:

1. **For Loop**

   * Best when we know exactly how many times we want to repeat something.
   * Here, we knew we wanted numbers from 1 to 5, so we wrote `for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++)`.

2. **While Loop**

   * Used when we don’t know the number of repetitions in advance.
   * In our example, it still works the same because we set the condition `i <= 5`.

3. **Do…While Loop**

   * Similar to while, but it **executes at least once** even if the condition is false.
   * In our case, it also prints numbers 1 to 5, but notice that the condition is checked **after** the loop runs.

---

### Another Example: Sum of First 5 Numbers

Let’s solve another problem using all three loops.
Problem: Find the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i, sum;

    // For loop
    sum = 0;
    for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum using for loop: %d\n", sum);

    // While loop
    sum = 0;
    i = 1;
    while (i <= 5) {
        sum += i;
        i++;
    }
    printf("Sum using while loop: %d\n", sum);

    // Do...While loop
    sum = 0;
    i = 1;
    do {
        sum += i;
        i++;
    } while (i <= 5);
    printf("Sum using do...while loop: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Output:

```
Sum using for loop: 15
Sum using while loop: 15
Sum using do...while loop: 15
```

---

### Key Takeaways:

* All three loops can solve the same problem.
* The difference lies in **syntax** and **when the condition is checked**.
* For beginners, remember:

  * **For loop** → when the number of iterations is known.
  * **While loop** → when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
  * **Do…while loop** → when you want the loop to run at least once.

---

### Question 1: Find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) using all three loops.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i, sum;

    printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Using for loop
    sum = 0;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum using for loop = %d\n", sum);

    // Using while loop
    sum = 0;
    i = 1;
    while (i <= n) {
        sum += i;
        i++;
    }
    printf("Sum using while loop = %d\n", sum);

    // Using do-while loop
    sum = 0;
    i = 1;
    do {
        sum += i;
        i++;
    } while (i <= n);
    printf("Sum using do-while loop = %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* All three loops perform the same task of repeatedly adding numbers from 1 to `n`.
* The only difference lies in their syntax and control flow.

### Question 2: Find the sum of digits of a number using all three loops

#### Problem:

Take an integer from the user and calculate the sum of its digits.
For example:

* If the number is `452`, the output should be `4 + 5 + 2 = 11`.

---

#### Solution:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, temp, sum, digit;

    // Taking input
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    // -------- Using for loop --------
    temp = num;
    sum = 0;
    for (; temp > 0; temp = temp / 10) {
        digit = temp % 10; 
        sum += digit;
    }
    printf("\nUsing for loop, sum of digits = %d\n", sum);

    // -------- Using while loop --------
    temp = num;
    sum = 0;
    while (temp > 0) {
        digit = temp % 10;
        sum += digit;
        temp = temp / 10;
    }
    printf("Using while loop, sum of digits = %d\n", sum);

    // -------- Using do-while loop --------
    temp = num;
    sum = 0;
    if (temp == 0) {
        sum = 0;   // edge case: number is 0
    } else {
        do {
            digit = temp % 10;
            sum += digit;
            temp = temp / 10;
        } while (temp > 0);
    }
    printf("Using do-while loop, sum of digits = %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

---

#### Explanation:

* In all three cases, we repeatedly take the **last digit** using `num % 10` and then **remove it** using `num / 10`.
* The difference lies only in **how the loop is written**.
* Edge case: If the number is `0`, the sum should be `0`. That’s why we handled it separately in `do-while`.

---

### Question 4: Print the multiplication table of a number (1 to 10) using all three loops

#### Problem

Read an integer `n` from the user and print its multiplication table from `1` to `10` using:

* `for` loop,
* `while` loop,
* `do-while` loop.

---

#### Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // -------- Using for loop --------
    printf("\nMultiplication table of %d using for loop:\n", n);
    for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n", n, i, n * i);
    }

    // -------- Using while loop --------
    printf("\nMultiplication table of %d using while loop:\n", n);
    i = 1; // reset
    while (i <= 10) {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n", n, i, n * i);
        i++;
    }

    // -------- Using do-while loop --------
    printf("\nMultiplication table of %d using do-while loop:\n", n);
    i = 1; // reset
    do {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n", n, i, n * i);
        i++;
    } while (i <= 10);

    return 0;
}
```

---

#### Sample Output (for input `4`)

```
Multiplication table of 4 using for loop:
4 x 1 = 4
4 x 2 = 8
4 x 3 = 12
4 x 4 = 16
4 x 5 = 20
4 x 6 = 24
4 x 7 = 28
4 x 8 = 32
4 x 9 = 36
4 x 10 = 40

Multiplication table of 4 using while loop:
4 x 1 = 4
...
4 x 10 = 40

Multiplication table of 4 using do-while loop:
4 x 1 = 4
...
4 x 10 = 40
```

---

#### Detailed Explanation of the Solution Logic

1. **Goal**

   * Print `n × i` for `i = 1` to `10`.
   * The sequence of multipliers is fixed (1 through 10), so each loop will run exactly 10 times.

2. **Core idea (common to all loops)**

   * Maintain a loop variable `i` that starts at `1`.
   * On each iteration, compute `n * i` and print `n x i = product`.
   * Increase `i` by `1` until it becomes `11` (i.e., the condition `i <= 10` becomes false).

3. **For loop logic**

   * Structure: `for (initialization; condition; update)`.
   * We write `for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++)` so:

     * Initialization: `i` starts at `1` (done once).
     * Condition: Check `i <= 10` before each iteration.
     * Update: `i++` after each iteration.
   * This is concise and ideal when the iteration count (10) is known.

4. **While loop logic**

   * Structure:

     * Initialize `i = 1` before the loop.
     * While `i <= 10`, print the line and then increment `i`.
   * This separates the three components (init/condition/update) across different lines, which is helpful for understanding flow step-by-step.

5. **Do-while loop logic**

   * Structure:

     * Initialize `i = 1`.
     * Execute the body once, then check `i <= 10` at the end.
   * Guarantees at least one print even if the initial condition would be false.
   * Here, since `i` starts at `1`, it will print 10 lines like the others.

6. **Loop Invariant (why it’s correct)**

   * At the start of each iteration with value `i`, all products `n × 1` through `n × (i - 1)` have already been printed, and the next correct product to print is `n × i`.
   * When the loop ends (i becomes 11), we have printed exactly `n × 1` to `n × 10`.

7. **Time and space complexity**

   * Time: `O(10)` → effectively constant, but generally `O(k)` if you print up to a limit `k`.
   * Space: `O(1)` → only a few integer variables.

8. **Edge cases**

   * `n = 0`: Every line prints `0`.
   * Negative `n`: The products are negative, but logic is unchanged.
   * Custom range: If you want up to `m` instead of `10`, replace `10` with `m` and read `m` from the user.

# Question 5: Reverse a Number

**Problem Statement:**
Write a C program to reverse a given number using **for loop**, **while loop**, and **do-while loop**.

---

### Explanation of Logic:

To reverse a number, we follow these steps:

1. Take the last digit of the number using the **modulus operator (`% 10`)**.
2. Add this digit to the reversed number by multiplying the reversed number by 10 and then adding the digit.
3. Remove the last digit from the number by using **integer division (`/ 10`)**.
4. Repeat the process until the number becomes 0.

For example, if the number is `1234`:

* Step 1: Extract `4` → reversed = 0 \* 10 + 4 = 4
* Step 2: Extract `3` → reversed = 4 \* 10 + 3 = 43
* Step 3: Extract `2` → reversed = 43 \* 10 + 2 = 432
* Step 4: Extract `1` → reversed = 432 \* 10 + 1 = 4321

So the reverse of `1234` is `4321`.

---

### Solution in C (All 3 Loops)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, temp, digit, reverse;

    // Input number
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    // -------- Using for loop --------
    temp = num;
    reverse = 0;
    for (; temp != 0; temp /= 10) {
        digit = temp % 10;        // Get last digit
        reverse = reverse * 10 + digit; // Build reversed number
    }
    printf("Reversed number using for loop: %d\n", reverse);

    // -------- Using while loop --------
    temp = num;
    reverse = 0;
    while (temp != 0) {
        digit = temp % 10;
        reverse = reverse * 10 + digit;
        temp /= 10;
    }
    printf("Reversed number using while loop: %d\n", reverse);

    // -------- Using do-while loop --------
    temp = num;
    reverse = 0;
    do {
        digit = temp % 10;
        reverse = reverse * 10 + digit;
        temp /= 10;
    } while (temp != 0);
    printf("Reversed number using do-while loop: %d\n", reverse);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Sample Input/Output:

**Input:**

```
Enter a number: 5678
```

**Output:**

```
Reversed number using for loop: 8765
Reversed number using while loop: 8765
Reversed number using do-while loop: 8765
```

---

### Question 6: Check if a Number is Palindrome

A **palindrome number** is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
For example: `121`, `1331`, `12321` are palindromes. But `123`, `4567` are not.

We will solve it using **for**, **while**, and **do-while** loops.

### Logic:

1. Take the input number (say `n`).
2. Store the original number in a temporary variable (`original`).
3. Reverse the number by extracting digits one by one:

   * Use `% 10` to get the last digit.
   * Build the reverse by `rev = rev * 10 + digit`.
   * Remove the last digit using `/ 10`.
4. Compare the reversed number with the original:

   * If they are equal → Palindrome.
   * Otherwise → Not a palindrome.

---

### Code Example: Palindrome Number in All 3 Loops

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, original, rev, digit;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    original = n;

    // ----- Using for loop -----
    rev = 0;
    for (int temp = n; temp > 0; temp /= 10) {
        digit = temp % 10;
        rev = rev * 10 + digit;
    }
    if (rev == original)
        printf("For Loop: %d is a Palindrome\n", original);
    else
        printf("For Loop: %d is Not a Palindrome\n", original);

    // ----- Using while loop -----
    rev = 0;
    int temp = n;
    while (temp > 0) {
        digit = temp % 10;
        rev = rev * 10 + digit;
        temp /= 10;
    }
    if (rev == original)
        printf("While Loop: %d is a Palindrome\n", original);
    else
        printf("While Loop: %d is Not a Palindrome\n", original);

    // ----- Using do-while loop -----
    rev = 0;
    temp = n;
    do {
        digit = temp % 10;
        rev = rev * 10 + digit;
        temp /= 10;
    } while (temp > 0);

    if (rev == original)
        printf("Do-While Loop: %d is a Palindrome\n", original);
    else
        printf("Do-While Loop: %d is Not a Palindrome\n", original);

    return 0;
}
```

## Question 7: Find Compound Interest

**Problem Statement:**
Write a program to calculate the compound interest (CI) given the **Principal Amount (P)**, **Rate of Interest (R)**, and **Time Period in years (T)**.

The formula for Compound Interest is:

$$
A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T
$$

$$
CI = A - P
$$

Where:

* $P$ = Principal amount (initial money invested/borrowed)
* $R$ = Annual interest rate (in percentage)
* $T$ = Time in years
* $A$ = Final amount after applying compound interest
* $CI$ = Compound Interest

We will solve this problem using **all three loops (for, while, do-while)**.

---

### Using **for loop**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double principal, rate, finalAmount, compoundInterest;
    int time, i;

    printf("Enter Principal Amount: ");
    scanf("%lf", &principal);

    printf("Enter Rate of Interest: ");
    scanf("%lf", &rate);

    printf("Enter Time (in years): ");
    scanf("%d", &time);

    finalAmount = principal;

    // Using for loop
    for (i = 1; i <= time; i++) {
        finalAmount = finalAmount * (1 + rate / 100);
    }

    compoundInterest = finalAmount - principal;
    printf("\n[For Loop] Compound Interest = %.2lf\n", compoundInterest);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Using **while loop**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double principal, rate, finalAmount, compoundInterest;
    int time, i = 1;

    printf("Enter Principal Amount: ");
    scanf("%lf", &principal);

    printf("Enter Rate of Interest: ");
    scanf("%lf", &rate);

    printf("Enter Time (in years): ");
    scanf("%d", &time);

    finalAmount = principal;

    // Using while loop
    while (i <= time) {
        finalAmount = finalAmount * (1 + rate / 100);
        i++;
    }

    compoundInterest = finalAmount - principal;
    printf("\n[While Loop] Compound Interest = %.2lf\n", compoundInterest);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Using **do-while loop**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double principal, rate, finalAmount, compoundInterest;
    int time, i = 1;

    printf("Enter Principal Amount: ");
    scanf("%lf", &principal);

    printf("Enter Rate of Interest: ");
    scanf("%lf", &rate);

    printf("Enter Time (in years): ");
    scanf("%d", &time);

    finalAmount = principal;

    // Using do-while loop
    do {
        finalAmount = finalAmount * (1 + rate / 100);
        i++;
    } while (i <= time);

    compoundInterest = finalAmount - principal;
    printf("\n[Do-While Loop] Compound Interest = %.2lf\n", compoundInterest);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Explanation of Logic**

1. We start with an **initial principal amount** (P).
2. For each year, the amount grows by multiplying with $(1 + R/100)$.

   * Example: If principal = 1000, rate = 10%, after 1 year:

     $$
     A = 1000 \times (1 + 0.10) = 1100
     $$
   * After 2 years:

     $$
     A = 1100 \times (1 + 0.10) = 1210
     $$
   * This continues for T years.
3. After completing all years (via loop), the **final amount** (A) is obtained.
4. Compound Interest is simply the **extra money earned/paid**:

   $$
   CI = A - P
   $$
5. We repeated the same logic using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

## Question 8: Check if a Number is an Armstrong Number

**Problem Statement:**
Write a program in C to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not using **all three loops** (for loop, while loop, do-while loop).

**What is an Armstrong Number?**
An Armstrong number (also called a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:

* 153 is an Armstrong number because:
  $1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153$
* 9474 is also an Armstrong number because:
  $9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 9474$.

---

### Solution in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>  // for pow function

int main() {
    int number, original, remainder, result, n, count = 0;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    original = number;

    // Step 1: Count digits
    n = number;
    while (n != 0) {
        n /= 10;
        count++;
    }

    // ---------------------------
    // Using FOR LOOP
    // ---------------------------
    result = 0;
    for (n = number; n != 0; n /= 10) {
        remainder = n % 10;
        result += pow(remainder, count);
    }
    if (result == number)
        printf("(For Loop) %d is an Armstrong number.\n", number);
    else
        printf("(For Loop) %d is NOT an Armstrong number.\n", number);

    // ---------------------------
    // Using WHILE LOOP
    // ---------------------------
    n = number;
    result = 0;
    while (n != 0) {
        remainder = n % 10;
        result += pow(remainder, count);
        n /= 10;
    }
    if (result == number)
        printf("(While Loop) %d is an Armstrong number.\n", number);
    else
        printf("(While Loop) %d is NOT an Armstrong number.\n", number);

    // ---------------------------
    // Using DO-WHILE LOOP
    // ---------------------------
    n = number;
    result = 0;
    do {
        remainder = n % 10;
        result += pow(remainder, count);
        n /= 10;
    } while (n != 0);

    if (result == number)
        printf("(Do-While Loop) %d is an Armstrong number.\n", number);
    else
        printf("(Do-While Loop) %d is NOT an Armstrong number.\n", number);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Logic

1. **Count the number of digits:**

   * First, we determine how many digits the number has.
   * Example: If input is `153`, it has **3 digits**.

2. **Extract each digit and raise it to the power of the number of digits:**

   * For `153`:

     * First digit: $1^3 = 1$
     * Second digit: $5^3 = 125$
     * Third digit: $3^3 = 27$

3. **Sum these values:**

   * $1 + 125 + 27 = 153$.

4. **Compare with original number:**

   * If the sum equals the original number, then it’s an **Armstrong number**. Otherwise, it’s not.

5. **Why we used three loops?**

   * The process of extracting digits (`% 10` and `/= 10`) can be done in **any loop type**.
   * Hence, we solve with for, while, and do-while to strengthen understanding of loops.

---

### Sample Output

```
Enter a number: 153
(For Loop) 153 is an Armstrong number.
(While Loop) 153 is an Armstrong number.
(Do-While Loop) 153 is an Armstrong number.
```

```
Enter a number: 123
(For Loop) 123 is NOT an Armstrong number.
(While Loop) 123 is NOT an Armstrong number.
(Do-While Loop) 123 is NOT an Armstrong number.
```

## Question 9: Write a program to generate Fibonacci series up to `n` terms using for loop, while loop, and do-while loop.

### Explanation of the Logic

The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
It starts with `0` and `1`.

So,

* 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …

Logic breakdown:

1. We first take input `n` = number of terms to be printed.
2. Initialize two variables: `first = 0`, `second = 1`.
3. Print the first two terms (0 and 1).
4. Use a loop to calculate the next term as:

   ```
   next = first + second
   ```
5. Update values:

   ```
   first = second
   second = next
   ```
6. Repeat until we get `n` terms.

We’ll implement the same with all three loops.

### C Program: Fibonacci Series with All Loops

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i;
    int first, second, next;

    printf("Enter the number of terms for Fibonacci series: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Using for loop
    printf("\nFibonacci Series using for loop:\n");
    first = 0, second = 1;
    printf("%d %d ", first, second); // print first two terms
    for(i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        next = first + second;
        printf("%d ", next);
        first = second;
        second = next;
    }

    // Using while loop
    printf("\n\nFibonacci Series using while loop:\n");
    first = 0, second = 1, i = 3;
    printf("%d %d ", first, second);
    while(i <= n) {
        next = first + second;
        printf("%d ", next);
        first = second;
        second = next;
        i++;
    }

    // Using do-while loop
    printf("\n\nFibonacci Series using do-while loop:\n");
    first = 0, second = 1, i = 3;
    printf("%d %d ", first, second);
    do {
        if (i > n) break; // safety check
        next = first + second;
        printf("%d ", next);
        first = second;
        second = next;
        i++;
    } while(i <= n);

    return 0;
}
```
