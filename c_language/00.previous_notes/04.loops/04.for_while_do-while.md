# Loops in C Language

In programming, **loops** are used when we want to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Instead of writing the same statements multiple times, we can use loops to make the program shorter, cleaner, and more efficient.

C language provides three main types of loops:

1. **for loop**
2. **while loop**
3. **do-while loop**

## 1. for loop

The **for loop** is most commonly used when we know in advance how many times we want to repeat a block of code.

### Syntax:

```c
for(initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

* **initialization** → executed once at the beginning (e.g., `int i = 1;`)
* **condition** → checked before each iteration. Loop runs until the condition is false.
* **update** → executed after each iteration (e.g., `i++`).

### Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i;
    for(i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## 2. while loop

The **while loop** is used when we don’t know exactly how many times the loop should run. The condition is checked **before** each iteration. If the condition is true, the code inside the loop executes.

### Syntax:

```c
while(condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

### Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;
    while(i <= 5) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

---

## 3. do-while loop

The **do-while loop** is similar to the while loop, but the **condition is checked after executing the loop body**. This means the loop will **always run at least once**, even if the condition is false.

### Syntax:

```c
do {
    // code to be executed
} while(condition);
```

### Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;
    do {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    } while(i <= 5);
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Key Differences Between Loops

| Loop Type         | Condition Checked     | Runs At Least Once? | Best Used When                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **for loop**      | Before each iteration | No                  | Number of iterations is known      |
| **while loop**    | Before each iteration | No                  | Number of iterations is unknown    |
| **do-while loop** | After each iteration  | Yes                 | At least one execution is required |

---

## Summary

* **for loop** → Use when you know the number of repetitions.
* **while loop** → Use when you don’t know the exact count in advance.
* **do-while loop** → Use when the loop must run at least once.
