# Why Learn C Language?

## ðŸ”¹ C is the Foundation
- Most modern languages like Java, C++, and Python are based on C.
- Understanding C helps you understand other programming languages more easily.

## ðŸ”¹ C is a System-Level Language
- System software like Operating Systems, Compilers, Device Drivers, and Embedded Systems are either written in C or still use C today.

## What is Software?
**Definition:** Software is a collection of programs.

**Examples:**
- **MS Word** = A collection of programs like New, Save, Cut, Paste.
- **Gmail** = A collection of modules like Login, Inbox, Compose.

## What is a Program?
**Definition:** A Program is a collection of instructions.

**Examples:**
- `printf()`
- `scanf()`

## Tools Needed to Run System Software

### **Compiler**
- Translates code into machine language (binary).

### **Interpreter**
- Translates code line by line during execution.

### **Loader**
- Loads the program into memory.

### **Linker**
- Combines different files and libraries into a single executable.

### **Drivers**
- Control hardware components (keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.).

### **Operating System**
- Manages the computerâ€™s resources.

## Why C Language is Important
- Oracle database systems are primarily written in C.
- The core libraries of the Android operating system are implemented in C.
- MySQL database is developed using C.
- A significant majority of device drivers are written in C.
- A major portion of web browser functionalities are developed in C.
- The Unix operating system was developed in C.
- C is considered one of the world's most popular programming languages.

## What is a Compiler?
A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code (written in a high-level language like C, C++, Java) into machine code (binary code) before the program is executed.

### How it Works:
1. Write the complete program in a high-level language.
2. The compiler checks the entire code for errors.
3. If there are no errors, it converts the code into an executable file (e.g., `.exe` in Windows).
4. This file can be run anytime without needing the compiler again.

**Advantages:**
- Faster execution (code is already in machine code).
- Once compiled, you donâ€™t need source code again to run the program.

**Disadvantages:**
- Must wait for the whole program to compile before running.
- Even one error stops compilation.

## What is an Interpreter?
An interpreter translates and executes code **line by line**.

### How it Works:
1. Write the source code.
2. Interpreter reads a line, translates it, and executes it.
3. Moves to the next line.
4. Stops at the first error and displays it.

**Advantages:**
- Great for debugging and learning.
- No need to compile the whole code.
- Errors are shown immediately.

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower execution (translates every time).
- Needs the interpreter installed to run.

## What is an Identifier?
An **identifier** is the name you give to variables, functions, arrays, structures, constants, etc. in your C program.

**Examples:**
```c
int age;        // 'age' is an identifier
float price;    // 'price' is an identifier
void display(); // 'display' is an identifier
```

### Rules for Naming Identifiers:
- Only letters (Aâ€“Z, aâ€“z), digits (0â€“9), and underscores `_` are allowed.
- Cannot start with a digit.
- Cannot be a C keyword (like `int`, `return`, `if`).
- Case-sensitive (`Roll` and `roll` are different).
- No special characters like `@`, `#`, `!`, etc.

**Valid Identifiers:**
```c
int total;
float _price;
char name1;
```

**Invalid Identifiers:**
```c
int 1total;   // starts with a number 
float @price; // contains @ 
char int;     // 'int' is a keyword 
```

---

## Keywords in C
**Definition:** Keywords are reserved words in C that have special meaning to the compiler.

**Rules:**
- Cannot be used as identifiers (variable or function names).

**List of C Keywords:**
```
auto        double      int         struct
break       else        long        switch
case        enum        register    typedef
char        extern      return      union
const       float       short       unsigned
continue    for         signed      void
default     goto        sizeof      volatile
do          if          static      while
```
