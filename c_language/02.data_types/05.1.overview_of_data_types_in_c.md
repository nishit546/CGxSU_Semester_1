# 05.1: Overview of Data Types in C

When you post on Instagram, you might share a **number** (likes), a **character** (emoji ❤️), a **text** (caption), or even a **true/false** setting (private vs public).
Similarly, when we write C programs, we need to tell the computer what kind of **data** we are working with.

This is where **Data Types** come in.

---

## 1. What are Data Types?

A **data type** defines:

1. **What kind of data** a variable can hold (integer, decimal, character, etc.).
2. **How much memory** it will use.
3. **What operations** can be performed on it.

👉 Example in C:

```c
int likes = 250;          // integer data type
float rating = 4.5;       // decimal value
char grade = 'A';         // single character
```

Just like apps enforce rules —

* Username must be text,
* Age must be a number,
* Profile visibility must be yes/no,

C enforces **data types** to keep your program consistent and safe.

## 2. Categories of Data Types in C

C broadly divides data types into **three categories**:

1. **Primitive (Basic) Types**

   * `int` → whole numbers
   * `float` → decimal numbers
   * `char` → single characters
   * `double` → high-precision decimals
   * `void` → no value

2. **Derived Types**

   * Arrays, Pointers, Functions

3. **User-defined Types**

   * Structures (`struct`), Enumerations (`enum`), Typedef

In Semester 1, our focus is **Primitive Types** and their variations (modifiers). We’ll touch derived and user-defined later.

## 3. Why Are Data Types Important?

Imagine your WhatsApp app stored everything as plain text:

* Your age would be `"20"` instead of a number.
* Your attendance could be `"85.5%"` instead of a float.
* Your profile picture file size would be just a `"string"` instead of bytes.

This would make comparisons and calculations impossible.

👉 In C:

```c
int age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
    printf("Adult");
}
```

Here, because `age` is **int**, C can compare it mathematically. If `age` were just text, the program wouldn’t know how to check `>= 18`.

## 4. Type Modifiers (A Sneak Peek)

Basic types can be **modified** to store smaller or larger ranges of values.

* `short int` → saves memory, used when values are small.
* `long long int` → used for very large values (like Aadhaar numbers, UPI transaction IDs).
* `unsigned int` → only non-negative values, doubles the range.

👉 Example:

```c
unsigned int followers = 1000000;   // no negatives needed
long long int views = 9876543210;   // huge number
```

We’ll cover this in depth in later articles.

## 5. Size and Range of Data Types

Different data types occupy different amounts of **memory (bytes)**.
The more memory, the **larger range** of values you can store.

👉 Example program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Size of int: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(int));
    printf("Size of char: %lu byte\n", sizeof(char));
    printf("Size of float: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(float));
    printf("Size of double: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(double));
    return 0;
}
```

Sample Output (on a 64-bit machine):

```
Size of int: 4 bytes
Size of char: 1 byte
Size of float: 4 bytes
Size of double: 8 bytes
```

---

## 6. A Note on Strings 

Unlike Python or Java, C does **not** have a built-in string type.
Strings are actually **character arrays** ending with a special `\0` (null character).

```c
char name[] = "CodingGita";   // actually {'C','o','d','i','n','g','G','i','t','a','\0'}
```

We’ll cover strings in detail after arrays, but for now, remember: **string = characters + `\0`**.

---

## 7. What’s Next?

In the next few articles, we’ll dive into:

1. **Primitive Data Types** (`int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `void`).
2. **Type Modifiers** (`short`, `long`, `signed`, `unsigned`).
3. **Size & Ranges with sizeof**.
4. **Overflow & Underflow issues**.
5. **Type Casting** rules.

By the end of this unit, you’ll know exactly **which data type to choose** in every situation — from storing marks, to usernames, to giant numbers like YouTube views.
