# **15.3: Applications of Arrays in C**

Arrays are not just about storing values — they are powerful because we can **perform operations** like:

* Searching for an element.
* Sorting elements in order.
* Finding sums, averages, max, min, etc.

---

## 1) Searching in Arrays

### 1.1 Linear Search (Simple)

Check every element **one by one** until we find the key.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int arr[] = {12, 45, 7, 23, 19};
    int n = 5, key = 23, found = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == key) {
            found = i;   // index where found
            break;
        }
    }

    if (found != -1)
        printf("Element %d found at index %d\n", key, found);
    else
        printf("Element %d not found\n", key);

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```
Element 23 found at index 3
```

---

### 1.2 Binary Search (Efficient but requires sorted array)

* Divide the array into halves repeatedly.
* Compare middle element with the key.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30};
    int n = 6, key = 20;
    int low = 0, high = n - 1, mid, found = -1;

    while (low <= high) {
        mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == key) {
            found = mid;
            break;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] < key)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            high = mid - 1;
    }

    if (found != -1)
        printf("Found %d at index %d\n", key, found);
    else
        printf("Not found\n");

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```
Found 20 at index 3
```

---

## 2) Sorting Arrays

### 2.1 Bubble Sort

Compare adjacent elements, swap if needed.
**Big idea:** Large elements “bubble” to the end.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22};
    int n = 5;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

    printf("Sorted array: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```
Sorted array: 12 22 25 34 64
```

## 3) Sum and Average of Array Elements

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int n = 5, sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) sum += arr[i];

    float avg = sum / (float)n;

    printf("Sum = %d\n", sum);
    printf("Average = %.2f\n", avg);

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```
Sum = 150
Average = 30.00
```

---

## 4) Finding Maximum and Minimum

```c
int arr[] = {23, 45, 12, 67, 34};
int n = 5;

int max = arr[0], min = arr[0];
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
    if (arr[i] < min) min = arr[i];
}
printf("Max = %d, Min = %d\n", max, min);
```

**Output**

```
Max = 67, Min = 12
```

---

## 5) Common Mistakes in Array Applications

1. Forgetting arrays are **0-indexed**.
   `arr[n]` is invalid for size `n`.

2. Using binary search on an **unsorted array**.

3. Not resetting loop variables in sorting.

4. Division in average must be done as **float**, not `int`.

---

## 6) Key Takeaways

* **Searching**: Linear (simple) vs Binary (efficient).
* **Sorting**: Bubble (easy).
* **Sum/Average**: Simple traversal.
* **Max/Min**: Compare as you traverse.
* Arrays are the **foundation for data structures** like stacks, queues, and matrices.
