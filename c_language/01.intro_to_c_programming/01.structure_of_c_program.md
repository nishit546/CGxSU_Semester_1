# üìò Topic 2: Structure of a C Program

Every programming language has its own ‚Äúgrammar‚Äù or structure. In C, the program structure is strict: **if you don‚Äôt follow it, your program won‚Äôt even compile.**
This topic explains the **sections of a C program** in detail with examples.

---

## 1. Basic Skeleton of a C Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // Preprocessor directive

int main() {         // Main function
    printf("Hello, CodingGita Students!\n");  // Output statement
    return 0;        // Exit status
}
```

Even this tiny code has multiple sections working together.

## 2. Components of a C Program (Detailed)

A structured C program usually has these sections:

---

### **(i) Documentation Section (Comments)**

This is where you describe the program for **humans**, not the computer.

* The compiler **ignores comments completely**.
* But for programmers, comments are **life-saving notes**.

**Types of comments in C:**

1. **Single-line comment** ‚Üí starts with `//`

   ```c
   // This program prints a welcome message
   ```
2. **Multi-line comment** ‚Üí starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`

   ```c
   /* This program was written by CodingGita team
      for Semester 1 students */
   ```

**Why comments are important:**

* Imagine writing a program today, then looking at it 6 months later. Without comments, you‚Äôll forget *why you wrote certain lines*.
* In a **team project**, comments help your teammates understand your logic.
* Professional companies require comments in every file and function (like documentation).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Common beginner mistake:**

> Some students write code without comments. It works now, but when the program grows to 200+ lines, it becomes impossible to follow. That‚Äôs why CodingGita insists you **always comment your code**.

---

### **(ii) Preprocessor Section**

This section always comes at the **top of the file**.

* Preprocessor directives **begin with `#`**.
* They are **not C statements** ‚Üí they don‚Äôt end with `;`.
* They run **before the compiler starts**.

**Common directives:**

* `#include <stdio.h>` ‚Üí adds the Standard Input/Output library (gives access to `printf`, `scanf`).
* `#include <math.h>` ‚Üí gives access to math functions like `sqrt`, `pow`.
* `#define PI 3.14` ‚Üí defines constants or simple macros.

Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // we need printf and scanf
#define MAX 100      // defining a constant
```

**Without this section:**

* If you write `printf("Hello");` without `#include <stdio.h>`, the compiler will throw an error because it doesn‚Äôt know what `printf` means.

---

### **(iii) Global Declaration Section**

This section comes after preprocessor but before `main()`.

**What we put here:**

* **Global variables** ‚Üí accessible from any function.
* **Function prototypes** ‚Üí tells the compiler about a function before it‚Äôs used.

Example:

```c
int totalStudents = 100;   // global variable

void greet();   // function prototype
```

**Why use it?**

* If you write `greet();` inside main without declaring it first, the compiler won‚Äôt know it exists ‚Üí error.
* Global variables are useful for data that multiple functions need to share.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Overusing global variables is a bad practice because they can be changed from anywhere, making debugging harder.

---

### **(iv) main() Function Section**

This is the **heart of the program**.

* Execution **always begins** with `main()`.
* Even if you have 100 functions, the program will still start with `main()`.

Structure:

```c
int main() {
    // variable declarations
    // executable statements
    return 0;
}
```

**Inside main():**

1. **Variable Declarations**

   ```c
   int marks;
   float average;
   char grade;
   ```

   Declaring tells the compiler: *reserve memory of this type*.

2. **Executable Statements**

   * Actual logic of the program: input, calculations, loops, function calls.

   ```c
   marks = 95;
   printf("Marks = %d", marks);
   ```

3. **Return Statement**

   * `return 0;` ‚Üí signals successful completion to the operating system.

---

### **(v) User-Defined Functions Section**

* Additional functions created by the programmer.
* They can be written before or after `main()`, but if after, they need a prototype.

Example:

```c
void greet() {
    printf("Welcome to CodingGita!\n");
}
```

**Why functions?**

* They allow **code reusability**.
* Make big programs manageable (divide work into smaller chunks).
* Later, when you study **modular programming, C++ classes, React components**, you‚Äôll see this same concept repeated.

## 3. Example Program with Structure

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // Preprocessor Section

// Global Declaration Section
int totalStudents = 50;  

// Function prototype
void greet();

int main() {   // main() function section
    // Variable declaration
    int marks = 90;
    char grade = 'A';
    
    // Executable statements
    greet();
    printf("Total Students: %d\n", totalStudents);
    printf("Marks: %d, Grade: %c\n", marks, grade);
    
    return 0;   // End of program
}

// User-defined function
void greet() {
    printf("Welcome to CodingGita Semester 1!\n");
}
```

---

## 4. Step-by-step Execution Flow

1. Preprocessor includes the header file `stdio.h`.
2. Compiler processes global variable `totalStudents` and prototype of `greet()`.
3. Execution jumps to **main()**.
4. Variables `marks` and `grade` are declared.
5. Function `greet()` is called ‚Üí prints message.
6. Program prints student data using `printf()`.
7. Program ends with `return 0;`.

**Output:**

```
Welcome to CodingGita Semester 1!
Total Students: 50
Marks: 90, Grade: A
```

## Key Takeaways

* Comments help humans, not computers ‚Äî but they‚Äôre **critical for readability**.
* Preprocessor directives bring in **libraries and constants** needed for your program.
* Global declarations define **variables and prototypes** used throughout the program.
* `main()` is **always the entry point**.
* Functions allow **modular, reusable code**.
