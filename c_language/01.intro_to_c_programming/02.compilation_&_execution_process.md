# ðŸ“˜ Topic 3: Compilation & Execution Process in C

When you write a program in C, you donâ€™t directly give instructions to the computer. Instead, there is a **step-by-step translation process** that converts your human-readable code into machine-executable code.

Understanding this process helps you:

* Debug errors better (knowing whether itâ€™s a compile-time error or run-time error).
* Appreciate how C interacts with hardware.
* Build a strong foundation for future subjects (like **Operating Systems and Compiler Design**).

## 1. What Happens After Writing a C Program?

Letâ€™s say you wrote a file called `hello.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, CodingGita!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

When you run it, the following **phases** take place:

## 2. Phases of Compilation and Execution

### **Step 1: Preprocessing**

* All lines starting with `#` (`#include`, `#define`) are handled here.
* The preprocessor expands macros, includes header files, and removes comments.
* Output of this step is a **modified source code** with all libraries included.

Example:

* `#include <stdio.h>` is replaced with the full contents of the standard I/O library.
* `#define PI 3.14` will replace every occurrence of `PI` with `3.14`.

File generated (in GCC): `hello.i` (preprocessed source code).

---

### **Step 2: Compilation**

* The preprocessed code is converted into **assembly language**.
* The compiler checks for **syntax errors** here.
* If you forget a semicolon or mismatch data types, errors show up in this stage.

File generated: `hello.s` (assembly code).

---

### **Step 3: Assembly**

* The assembly code is translated into **object code** (machine language, binary form).
* This is not yet a complete program, because libraries are not linked.

File generated: `hello.o` (object file).

---

### **Step 4: Linking**

* The object code is linked with standard library functions (`printf`, `scanf`, etc.).
* Without linking, your code would not know how `printf` actually works.
* The linker combines your program with required libraries.

File generated: `hello.exe` (Windows) or `a.out` (Linux/Mac).

---

### **Step 5: Loading & Execution**

* The final executable is loaded into **main memory** (RAM).
* The **loader** assigns CPU time, and execution begins from the `main()` function.

Output on screen:

```
Hello, CodingGita!
```

          v
   Preprocessor (expands headers, macros)
          |
          v
   Compiler (converts to assembly)
          |
          v
   Assembler (converts to object code)
          |
          v
   Linker (links with libraries)
          |
          v
   Executable File (hello.exe / a.out)
          |
          v
   Loader -> Execution starts at main()
```

## 4. Types of Errors in This Process

1. **Compile-time Errors** (during compilation)

   * Syntax mistakes (`missing ;`, wrong variable type).
   * Example:

     ```c
     int x = "Hello";   // error: incompatible types
     ```

2. **Linker Errors** (during linking)

   * Using a function without including its library.
   * Example: calling `sqrt()` without `#include <math.h>`.

3. **Run-time Errors** (during execution)

   * Divide by zero, invalid memory access.
   * Example:

     ```c
     int a = 5, b = 0;
     printf("%d", a/b);  // runtime error: division by zero
     ```

4. **Logical Errors** (no error, but wrong output)

   * Example: using `+` instead of `*` in a formula.

## 5. Real-Life Analogy

Think of this process like **publishing a YouTube video**:

* **Preprocessing** â†’ You prepare raw clips (header files included).
* **Compilation** â†’ You edit the clips into a proper sequence (assembly code).
* **Assembly** â†’ Export the video into a format (object file).
* **Linking** â†’ Add background music and graphics from libraries (libraries linked).
* **Execution** â†’ Final video uploaded and played by viewers (program runs).

Just like you canâ€™t upload raw clips without editing, you canâ€™t run raw C code without compilation and linking.
