# ðŸ“˜ Unit 1: Introduction to C Programming

---

## **Section A: Basics & Tokens**

1. Write a C program to print your **name, branch, and enrollment number** in 3 separate lines using `\n`.
2. Write a program to demonstrate **5 different tokens** (keyword, identifier, constant, operator, special symbol) in a single line of code. Comment on each token.
3. Write a program that uses **all 5 escape sequences** (`\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`, `\'`) in a meaningful sentence.
4. Modify a simple program to introduce **intentional syntax errors** (missing semicolon, unmatched braces) and record the compiler error messages.
5. Write a program that prints `sizeof` values for `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`, and `long int`. Explain the output in terms of tokens used.

## **Section B: Keywords, Identifiers, Constants**

6. Write a program that demonstrates **case sensitivity** of identifiers (`marks` vs `Marks`).
7. Define a constant `PI = 3.14159`. Take radius as input and calculate area of circle. Show why using a constant is better than hardcoding.
8. Show difference between **character constant** `'A'` and string constant `"A"` using `printf` with `%c` and `%s`.
9. Create a program that asks user for marks in 3 subjects. Use **constant for passing marks** and check if student passes all subjects.
10. Show invalid identifier examples (`1name`, `int`, `total-marks`) by attempting compilation. Then write correct alternatives.

## **Section C: Input/Output & Format Specifiers**

11. Write a program that accepts integer, float, character, and string input in one run and prints them using `%d`, `%f`, `%c`, `%s`.
12. Extend the above to print the float with **2 decimal places** and string in quotes using `\"`.
13. Write a program that asks user for **first name and last name separately**, then prints full name in one line. (Use `%s` twice).
14. Demonstrate the error when forgetting `&` in `scanf`. Record and explain the behavior.
15. Write a program that shows the problem of `scanf("%s")` with a string containing space (e.g., `"Mahir Patel"`). Show that only `"Mahir"` is captured.

## **Section D: Mini Applications**

16. Write a program to create a **student mark sheet**: input roll no, name, 3 subject marks. Print a formatted report with total and average.
17. Write a program to accept date input in `dd mm yyyy` format and print it as `dd-mm-yyyy`.
18. Create a **menu-driven mini-calculator** using only `if-else` and operators (+, -, \*, /). Input two numbers and an operator.
19. Write a program that prints a **tabular timetable** (Monâ€“Fri Ã— 5 periods) using only `printf` with `\t`.
20. Challenge: Write a program that accepts a studentâ€™s name, enrollment, 3 subject marks, and prints the result in the following format using escape sequences:

```
====================================
      CodingGita Student Report     
====================================
Name: Arjun Patel
Roll: 23
Marks: 78  85  90
Total: 253
Average: 84.33
====================================
```
