# 📘 Unit 4: Control Flow 

## **A) If & If-Else (Decision Making)**

1. Write a program that accepts an integer from the user and determines whether the number is **positive, negative, or zero**. Display a clear message for each case.

2. Design a program that accepts two integers and prints the **greater number**. If both are equal, print “Both are equal.”

3. A student passes if their marks are **≥ 40**. Write a program that inputs marks and prints whether the student has **passed or failed**.

4. Create a program that accepts three integers and prints the **largest number** among them.

5. Write a program that checks if a number is divisible by **both 5 and 11**. If yes, print “Divisible by 5 and 11,” otherwise print “Not divisible.”

6. Design a grading program:

   * Marks ≥ 90 → Grade A
   * 75–89 → Grade B
   * 50–74 → Grade C
   * < 50 → Fail

7. Write a program to check if a given year is a **leap year**. (Rule: Divisible by 4 but not 100, OR divisible by 400).

8. Develop a program that checks whether a character entered by the user is a **vowel, consonant, digit, or special character**.

9. Create a program that checks if a person is **eligible for driving license** (age ≥ 18).

10. Write a program that takes three angles as input and checks if they form a **valid triangle** (sum = 180°).

## **B) Nested If**

11. Write a program that checks if a number is **positive and even**, **positive and odd**, or **negative**.

12. Develop a program to determine whether three sides form an **equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle**.

13. Input marks and check whether the student has **distinction (≥75), first class (60–74), pass (40–59), or fail (<40)**.

14. Write a program that checks whether a given character is **uppercase, lowercase, digit, or special symbol** using nested `if`.

15. Create a simple **login system**: the program should accept username and password (hardcoded values) and check if both are correct.

## **C) Switch-Case**

16. Write a program to create a **simple calculator** using `switch-case` for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

17. Develop a program that accepts a number (1–7) and prints the **day of the week**.

18. Create a program that accepts a number (1–12) and prints the **month name**.

19. Write a program that inputs an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and two numbers, then performs the respective operation using `switch`.

20. Create a **menu-driven program**:

21. Find area of circle

22. Find area of rectangle

23. Find area of triangle
    The program should accept choice and calculate accordingly.

---

## **D) For Loop**

21. Write a program that prints numbers from **1 to N** using a `for` loop.

22. Develop a program that prints all **even numbers between 1 and 50** using a loop.

23. Create a program to find the **sum of first N natural numbers**.

24. Write a program to print the **multiplication table** of a given number.

25. Develop a program to find the **factorial of a number** using a `for` loop.

---

## **E) While Loop**

26. Write a program to **reverse a number** using a `while` loop.

27. Create a program that **counts the digits** of a number.

28. Write a program that calculates the **sum of digits** of a given number.

29. Develop a program that checks whether a number is a **palindrome** (same forward and backward).

30. Write a program to print the **Fibonacci series** up to N terms using a `while` loop.

---

## **F) Do-While Loop**

31. Write a program that keeps accepting numbers until the user enters **0**, then prints the **sum of all entered numbers**.

32. Develop a program that repeatedly asks for a password until the user enters the **correct password**.

33. Write a **menu-driven program** (using do-while) that allows repeated calculations until the user chooses exit.

34. Write a program to print all the **digits of a number** one by one using `do-while`.

35. Develop a program that calculates the **sum of odd numbers** up to N using a `do-while` loop.

---

## **G) Nested Loops (Patterns & Grids)**

36. Write a program to print a **3×3 grid** of numbers using nested loops.

37. Create a program to print a **right-angled triangle pattern** of stars.

38. Write a program to print a **number triangle** where each row prints numbers from 1 to row number.

39. Develop a program to print a **multiplication table from 1 to 10** using nested loops.

40. Write a program to input a 3×3 matrix from the user and print it in **grid format**.

41. Develop a program to print a **pyramid pattern** of stars using nested loops.

---

## **H) Jump Statements (break, continue, goto)**

42. Write a program to demonstrate `break` in a loop by printing numbers from 1 to 100, but stopping when the number becomes greater than 50.

43. Write a program to demonstrate `continue` by printing numbers from 1 to 20, but skipping all even numbers.

44. Create a program using `goto` to jump back and re-enter a password if the entered one is wrong.

45. Write a program to search for a number in a 2D matrix. Use `break` to stop searching once the number is found.

46. Write a program to demonstrate the difference between `break` and `continue` inside nested loops.
