## **A) Arithmetic Operators**

1. Write a program that takes two integers and prints sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.
2. Write a program that inputs marks in 5 subjects and prints total and average using arithmetic operators.
3. Write a program to calculate **simple interest** and **compound interest**.
4. Write a program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
5. Write a program to evaluate `a^2 + b^2 + 2ab` (expand `(a+b)^2`).

## **B) Relational Operators**

6. Write a program that checks if an entered number is greater than, less than, or equal to 100.
7. Write a program that compares two ages and prints who is older.
8. Write a program to check if a student has passed (marks â‰¥ 40).
9. Write a program to check if a character is uppercase, lowercase, digit, or special symbol.
10. Write a program to check whether three sides can form a valid triangle (triangle inequality).

## **C) Logical Operators**

11. Write a program that checks if a student is eligible for placement: **CGPA â‰¥ 7.0 AND attendance â‰¥ 75%.**
12. Write a program to check if a number is divisible by 3 OR 5.
13. Write a program to check if a year is a **leap year**.
14. Write a program to check if entered username AND password are correct.
15. Write a program to check if a character is a vowel (use `||` operator).

---

## **D) Assignment Operators**

16. Write a program to show use of `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`.
17. Write a program that doubles a number without using `*` (use `+=`).
18. Write a program to accumulate sum of numbers entered by the user using `+=`.
19. Write a program that calculates power of 2 (`2^n`) using `<<` OR repeated multiplication.
20. Write a program to rotate a number left by 1 digit (e.g., `1234 â†’ 2341`) using `%` and `/`.

---

## **E) Increment / Decrement**

21. Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using only `++`.
22. Write a program that shows the difference between pre-increment and post-increment.
23. Write a program that counts digits in a number using `while (n > 0) { count++; n/=10; }`.
24. Write a program that simulates a simple counter: `++likes` every time user presses enter.
25. Write a program to show how `i++ + ++i` behaves (with explanation).

---

## **F) Bitwise Operators & Applications**

26. Write a program to check if a number is **even or odd** using bitwise `& 1`.
27. Write a program to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable (using XOR).
28. Write a program that uses bits to track attendance of 8 students (1 = present, 0 = absent). Print attendance status of each.
29. Write a program that extracts the 3rd bit of a number using `(n >> 2) & 1`.
30. Write a program to multiply and divide a number by 2 using left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`).

---

## **G) Operator Precedence**

31. Write a program to evaluate `10 + 20 * 30`. Show output with and without parentheses.
32. Write a program to evaluate `(x > y && y > z) || (x == z)`. Print result for different values of `x,y,z`.
33. Write a program that shows difference between `a = b = c` and `(a = b) = c`.
34. Write a program that evaluates `2 + 3 * 5 > 20 && 4 != 2`. Print step-by-step evaluation.
35. Write a program to demonstrate associativity of `=`, `?:`, and `&&`.
