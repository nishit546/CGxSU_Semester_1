# Pattern Questions 

### 1. Single Row of Stars
   Input example: `n = 5`

```
*****
```

Description & approach

* Objective: print a straight line of `n` stars.
* Approach: single loop that prints `*` exactly `n` times.
  Hints
* If printing with separators, avoid trailing extra characters at the end of the line.
  Common pitfalls
* Off-by-one: printing `n+1` or `n-1` stars.
  Difficulty: Easy

---

### 2. Single Row of Numbers
   Input example: `n = 5`

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

Description & approach

* Objective: print numbers `1` to `n` separated by a single space in one line.
* Approach: single loop from 1 to `n`. Print a space after each number except optionally the last one (or trim).
  Hints
* Decide whether you want a trailing space or not; many judges allow it but it’s cleaner to avoid it.
  Common pitfalls
* Printing the numbers without spaces (e.g., `12345`) or wrong start index.
  Difficulty: Easy

---

### 3. Single Row of Alphabets
   Input example: `n = 5`

```
A B C D E
```

Description & approach

* Objective: print letters starting from `A` for `n` characters.
* Approach: loop `i` from `0` to `n-1`, print `chr('A' + i)` separated by spaces.
  Hints
* If `n > 26`, define whether to wrap to `A` again or stop at `Z`. For beginners, keep `n ≤ 26`.
  Common pitfalls
* Off-by-one in ASCII offset (use `'A' + i` where i starts at 0).
  Difficulty: Easy

---

### 4. Square of Stars
   Input example: `n = 4`

```
****
****
****
****
```

Description & approach

* Objective: print an `n × n` block of stars.
* Approach: outer loop for `n` rows; for each row, inner loop prints `n` stars.
  Hints
* Visualize the grid: rows and columns are symmetric here.
  Common pitfalls
* Confusing rows and columns; printing different counts per row.
  Difficulty: Easy

---

### 5. Square of Numbers (row-wise)
   Input example: `n = 4`

```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```

Description & approach

* Objective: print `n` rows, each row printing numbers `1` to `n`.
* Approach: outer loop for rows, inner loop prints `1..n` each time.
  Hints

  Common pitfalls
* Forgetting to reset the inner loop each row.
  Difficulty: Easy

---

### 6. Square of Alphabets (row-wise)

A B C D
```

Description & approach

* Objective: `n` rows, each row prints alphabets `A`..`A + n - 1`.
* Approach: outer loop for rows, inner loop prints letters from `A`.
  Hints
* Keep `n ≤ 26` for simplicity.
  Common pitfalls
* Using ASCII offsets incorrectly; each column is `A + colIndex`.
  Difficulty: Easy

---

### 7. Right-angled Triangle — Stars (increasing)
   Input example: `n = 5`

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

Description & approach

```

Description & approach

* Objective: row `r` prints numbers from `1` to `r`.
* Approach: outer loop for rows; inner loop prints `1..row`.

  Common pitfalls
* Forgetting spaces between numbers or trailing spaces.
  Difficulty: Easy

---

### 9. Right-angled Triangle — Alphabets (increasing)
   Input example: `n = 5`

```

```

Description & approach

* Objective: row `r` prints letters `A`..`A + r - 1`.
* Approach: outer loop rows, inner loop columns mapping to letters.
  Hints
* This reinforces the mapping between column index and printed token (number or char).
  Common pitfalls
* Starting letter offset wrong (should begin at `A`).
  Difficulty: Easy

---

### 10. Right-Aligned Triangle — Stars
    Input example: `n = 5`

```
    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****
```

Description & approach

* Objective: right-aligned triangle with row `r` containing `r` stars at the right.
* Approach: for each row `r` (1..n) print `(n - r)` spaces, then print `r` stars. Two parts per row: leading spaces, then stars.
  Hints
* Count spaces exactly — drawing the pattern on paper helps.
* For text output, a “space” is a single character. If you later print tokens that include a following space (e.g., `number + " "`), you may need to double up leading spaces to keep visual alignment.
  Common pitfalls
* Using the same number of spaces for all rows; forgetting that spaces decrease as rows increase.
  Difficulty: Medium

---

### 11. Right-Aligned Triangle — Numbers
    Input example: `n = 5`

```
        1
      1 2
    1 2 3
  1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

Description & approach

* Objective: a number triangle aligned to the right. Each row `r` prints `1..r` preceded by spaces so the block is right-aligned.
* Approach: for row `r`, print `(n - r)` groups of spaces, then print numbers `1..r` separated by a single space.
  Hints
* Because numbers are printed with spaces between them, one visual unit per number is roughly 2 characters (`digit + space`). For neat alignment you can either:

  * Print two spaces per missing number (i.e., leading spaces = `2 * (n - r)`), or
  * Use formatting that reserves fixed width per number (beginner-friendly approach: use `2*(n - r)` spaces).
    Common pitfalls
* Not compensating leading spaces for the extra space characters between numbers; result looks shifted.
  Difficulty: Medium

---

### 12. Right-Aligned Triangle — Alphabets
    Input example: `n = 5`

```
        A
      A B
    A B C
  A B C D
A B C D E
```

Description & approach

* Objective: similar to the numeric right-aligned triangle but print letters instead. Row `r` prints `A..A + r - 1` with leading spaces.
* Approach: for row `r`, print `(n-r)` leading spacing groups (follow the same method as numbers for visual alignment), then print letters separated by single spaces.
  Hints
* Same alignment caveat as numbers: letters plus following space make token width; you may want `2*(n - r)` leading spaces for consistent look.
  Common pitfalls
* Miscounting leading spaces; forgetting to treat each printed token uniformly.
  Difficulty: Medium

---

### 13. Full Pyramid — Stars (centered)
    Input example: `n = 5`

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

Description & approach

* Objective: centered pyramid with `n` rows; row `r` has `2*r - 1` stars, centered with `(n - r)` leading spaces.
* Approach (per row r from 1 to n):

  1. Print `(n - r)` spaces.
  2. Print `2*r - 1` stars (no internal spaces between stars).
     Hints
* Visualize the pyramid as two halves mirrored around the center. The formula `2*r - 1` produces the odd star counts.
* For text containing tokens with separators (numbers/letters), alignment requires extra attention (see Q14–Q15).
  Common pitfalls
* Printing `2*r` or `2*r+1` stars by mistake; incorrect number of spaces.
  Difficulty: Medium

---

### 14. Full Pyramid — Numbers (centered)
    Input example: `n = 5`

```
        1
      1 2 3
    1 2 3 4 5
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

Description & approach

* Objective: centered number pyramid where row `r` prints numbers from `1` to `2*r - 1` (or visually, an odd-count sequence). Often easier to think: print numbers `1..(2*r - 1)` or print `1..r` then `r-1..1`.
* Approach variants:

  * Simple: print `2*r - 1` increasing numbers (1,2,3...) in each row (this matches the example but is not a palindrome).
  * Alternative (palindrome variant): print `1..r` then `r-1..1`. Both are widely used — pick one consistently and give students that spec.
    Hints
* Spaces to center: treat each printed token as having width (token + following space). A practical beginner rule is to print `2*(n - r)` leading spaces when printing items separated by spaces. That makes the visual center look correct.
  Common pitfalls
* Confusion about whether the row is a palindrome or just an increasing odd count — specify which you want.
  Difficulty: Medium

---

### 15. Full Pyramid — Alphabets (centered)
    Input example: `n = 5`

```
        A
      A B C
    A B C D E
  A B C D E F G
A B C D E F G H I
```

Description & approach

* Objective: centered pyramid with alphabets; row `r` contains `2*r - 1` alphabet tokens (starting from `A`) centered.
* Approach: per row `r` print appropriate leading spacing then print letters (e.g., `A` to `A + 2*r - 2`) or alternatively print `A..A+(r-1)` then `A+(r-2)..A` if you want a specific mirrored order. The example above prints increasing sequence of distinct letters across the row.
  Hints
* Keep track of the current letter index carefully. For `n > 26`, decide whether to wrap or stop. For beginners use `n ≤ 13` for safe non-wrapping within the full pyramid.
* For neat centering when letters are printed with separators, use `2*(n - r)` leading spaces.
  Common pitfalls
* Running past `Z` without wrapping rule; miscounting letters per row.
  Difficulty: Medium
