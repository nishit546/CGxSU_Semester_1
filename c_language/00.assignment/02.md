# ðŸ“˜ Unit 2: Data Types 

---

## **A) Primitive Data Types (Foundation)**

1. Write a program that declares variables of type `int`, `float`, `char`, and `double`, assigns values, and prints them with correct format specifiers.
2. Declare an integer `followers = 2500`. Print the same using `%d` and `%f`. Explain the difference.
3. Write a program that takes your **age** as integer and **height** as float, then prints:

   ```
   I am 20 years old and 5.75 feet tall.
   ```
4. Show that `char` stores ASCII codes: declare `char c = 'A'` and print with both `%c` and `%d`.
5. Demonstrate precision loss by storing `3.1415926535` in both `float` and `double`. Print up to 10 decimal places.

## **B) Type Modifiers (short, long, signed, unsigned)**

6. Write a program to print `sizeof(short int)`, `sizeof(long int)`, `sizeof(long long int)`.
7. Input a negative number into an `unsigned int` and print it. Explain the output.
8. Write a program that declares `unsigned char` and assigns `250`. Print it as integer.
9. Demonstrate the difference between `int`, `long`, and `long long` by storing a large roll number like `202512345678`.
10. Write a program to calculate factorial of a number using `unsigned long long` to avoid overflow.

---

## **C) Size and Range (sizeof operator)**

11. Write a program that prints size (bytes) of all primitive data types using `sizeof`.
12. Extend the above program to print size of type-modified versions: `short`, `long`, `unsigned`, etc.
13. Create a program that asks user to enter a variable and prints both value and its size using `sizeof`.
14. Write a program that prints min and max value of `int` using `<limits.h>` macros (`INT_MIN`, `INT_MAX`).
15. Do the same for `float` using `<float.h>` macros.

---

## **D) Integer Overflow / Underflow**

16. Write a program that assigns `INT_MAX` to an `int` and then adds 1. Observe and print the result.
17. Repeat above for `INT_MIN - 1`.
18. Write a program that shows overflow behavior in `unsigned int` by assigning `UINT_MAX + 1`.
19. Demonstrate a loop that starts from 250 and keeps incrementing `unsigned char` until it overflows and wraps to 0.
20. Write a program to check if adding 1 to `long long int` (very large number) causes overflow.

---

## **E) Type Casting (implicit & explicit)**

21. Write a program that divides two integers `5/2` and prints result. Then cast one operand to float and show difference.
22. Demonstrate implicit conversion by assigning an `int` to a `float` and printing.
23. Show explicit conversion by converting `float gpa = 8.9` into integer.
24. Write a program that takes two integers and prints their average both as integer and as float (using casting).
25. Write a program that converts total seconds into hours\:minutes\:seconds using integer division and modulo operator.
