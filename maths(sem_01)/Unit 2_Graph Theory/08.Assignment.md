
# 🧮 **Graph Traversals — BFS & DFS **

---

## 🧠 **Concept Recap**

* **BFS (Breadth-First Search):**
  Traverses **level by level** using a **queue (FIFO)** structure.
  👉 Ideal for **shortest path** problems.

* **DFS (Depth-First Search):**
  Traverses **deeply first**, using **stack (LIFO)** or **recursion**.
  👉 Ideal for **path discovery** or **cycle detection**.
