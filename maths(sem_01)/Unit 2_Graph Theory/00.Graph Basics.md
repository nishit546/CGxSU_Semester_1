# 📘 **Graph Basics**


## 🟦 **1. Definition of Graph** 🔍

A **graph** is a **non-linear data structure** consisting of a **set of vertices (V)** and a **set of edges (E)** that connect pairs of vertices.
Formally, it is denoted as:
👉 **G = (V, E)**

* **Vertices (nodes)** represent entities.
* **Edges (links)** represent the relationships between those entities.
* Graphs can be **directed** (edges have direction) or **undirected** (edges are bidirectional).
* They can also be **weighted** (edges have values like distance or cost) or **unweighted**.

Graphs are used in **social networks**, **transportation routes**, **network topologies**, and **recommendation systems**.

```

Here, **A, B, C, D** are vertices and the connecting lines are edges.

## 🟩 **2. Vertices (Nodes)** 🧱

A **vertex** represents an **entity or object** in a graph. Each vertex stores data or identifiers.
In real-world applications:

* In social networks → a user is a vertex
* In road maps → a city is a vertex
* In networks → a computer is a vertex

The total number of vertices is denoted as **|V|**.
Vertices play a central role in graph algorithms such as **DFS**, **BFS**, and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.

## 🟧 **3. Edges** 🔗

An **edge** represents a **connection or relationship** between two vertices.
It can be:

* **Directed (A → B)** → one-way relationship
* **Undirected (A — B)** → mutual relationship
* **Weighted (A —5— B)** → includes cost or distance

Edges are essential for determining connectivity, shortest paths, and flow between nodes.

## 🟨 **4. Degree** 🔢

The **degree of a vertex** is the number of edges connected to it.
In **undirected graphs**,

> Degree(v) = number of edges incident on v
In **directed graphs**,

* **In-degree:** edges entering a vertex
* **Out-degree:** edges leaving a vertex

👉 In undirected graphs:
**Sum of degrees = 2 × number of edges**
