## 🧭 **Graph Traversal – Introduction**

Graph traversal means **visiting each vertex (node)** of a graph in a systematic manner to explore all its connections.
It is one of the most important concepts in **Graph Theory** and **Computer Science applications** such as:
📍 finding paths,
📍 detecting cycles,
📍 and exploring networks.

There are mainly **two types of graph traversals**:

1. 🔹 **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
2. 🔹 **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

---

## 🚀 **1️⃣ Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

### 💡 **Concept Overview**

Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores the graph **level by level**.
It starts from a **source node**, visits all its **immediate neighbors first**, then moves on to the neighbors’ neighbors.
It uses a **Queue (FIFO)** structure — First In, First Out.

✅ **Key Idea:** Visit **all nodes at the same depth** before going deeper.

---

### 🧩 **Algorithm Steps**

1. Choose a **starting vertex** and mark it as **visited**.
2. Place it in a **Queue**.
3. Remove the vertex from the front of the queue.
4. Add all its **unvisited neighbors** to the queue and mark them as visited.
5. Repeat until the queue is empty.

### 🧮 **Example 1: BFS Traversal**

**Start from vertex A**

**Step-by-step process:**

1. Visit A → Queue = [A]
2. Visit B, C (neighbors of A) → Queue = [B, C]
3. Visit D (from B) → Queue = [C, D]
4. Visit E, F (from C) → Queue = [D, E, F]
5. All visited ✅

➡️ **BFS Order:** `A → B → C → D → E → F`

**📊 Level Representation:**

```
Level 0: A
Level 1: B, C
Level 2: D, E, F
```

### 🧮 **Example 2: BFS in Linear Graph**

```
A — B — C — D — E
```

* Start from A
* Visit all in sequence
  ➡️ **Output:** `A → B → C → D → E`
  🧠 **All nodes are in one single level chain.**

### 🧮 **Example 3: BFS in Star Graph**

```
     (A)
    / | \
  (B)(C)(D)
```

* Start from A
* Visit direct neighbors B, C, D
  ➡️ **Output:** `A → B → C → D`

**🧠 BFS is perfect for such wide graphs.**

### 🧮 **Example 4: BFS in Directed Graph**

```
A → B → C → D
```

**Start from A:**
➡️ Traversal Order: `A → B → C → D`
**🎯 Simple direction-following traversal.**

### 🧮 **Example 5: BFS in Disconnected Graph**

```
(A) — (B)     (C) — (D)
```

* Start from A → visit (A, B)
* Then start new BFS from C → visit (C, D)
  ➡️ **Result:** `A B | C D`
  🧠 **BFS explores each component separately.**

### 🧮 **Example 6: BFS for Shortest Path**

```
A — B — C — D
 \         /
   \— E —/
```

**Find shortest path from A → D**

* Path 1: A → B → C → D (3 steps)
* Path 2: A → E → D (2 steps ✅)
  🎯 **Shortest Path = A → E → D**

---

### ⚙️ **Complexity**

* **Time:** O(V + E)
* **Space:** O(V) (for queue and visited list)

## 🕵️‍♂️ **2️⃣ Depth-First Search (DFS)**

### 💡 **Concept Overview**

Depth-First Search (DFS) explores the graph **as deeply as possible** before backtracking.
It uses a **Stack (LIFO)** structure or recursion.

✅ **Key Idea:** Go **deep** into one path before trying another.

---

### 🧩 **Algorithm Steps**

1. Start from a source vertex, mark it **visited**.
2. Go to an **unvisited adjacent vertex** and continue recursively.
3. If no unvisited vertex exists, **backtrack** to the previous vertex.
4. Continue until all vertices are visited.

**Steps:**

1. Visit A
2. Move to B
3. From B → go to D
4. From D → go to E
5. From E → go to C
6. From C → go to F
   ✅ **DFS Order:** `A → B → D → E → C → F`

* Or A → E → D ✅
  🧠 **DFS explores one complete branch before trying another.**
