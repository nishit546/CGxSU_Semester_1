# 📘 SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS – COMPLETE NOTES  

A **system of linear equations** is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same variables. The solution of the system is the set of values that satisfies **all the equations simultaneously**. For systems with two variables, each equation represents a straight line on a graph, and the solution corresponds to the **point of intersection of the lines** 📍.  

Such systems are widely used in **engineering 🔧, economics 💰, physics ⚙️, computer science 💻, and business applications**. Depending on the nature of the equations, a system can have:  
- ✅ **One unique solution** (intersecting lines)  
- ❌ **No solution** (parallel lines)  
- ♾️ **Infinitely many solutions** (coincident lines)  

Two important algebraic techniques used to solve these systems are:  
1. **Elimination Method**  
2. **Matrix Method**

## 🔹 1. ELIMINATION METHOD – DEFINITION & DETAILED EXPLANATION ✏️  

### ✅ Definition  
The **elimination method** is a systematic algebraic technique used to solve a system of linear equations by **eliminating one variable at a time** through addition or subtraction of equations.

### 🎯 Core Idea  
We make the coefficients of one variable **equal or opposite**, so that when we add or subtract the equations, that variable gets **cancelled automatically**.

### 📝 Steps of the Elimination Method  
1. Write both equations in standard form:  
[a_1x + b_1y = c_1]\
[a_2x + b_2y = c_2]
2. Multiply one or both equations (if required) to make coefficients equal.  
3. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.  
4. Solve the resulting equation.  
5. Substitute the value into any original equation.  
6. Write the solution as an ordered pair $$ (x, y) $$.

### ✅ Example 1: Infinitely Many Solutions ♾️  

Solve:  
$$[2x + y = 5]\\
[2x + y = 5]$$

Subtracting both equations:  
$$(2x + y) - (2x + y) = 5 - 5 \\
0 = 0)$$  

**Conclusion:** Infinitely many solutions (Coincident lines)

### ✅ Example 2: Unique Solution ✅  

Solve:  
$$
x + y = 10 \\
x - y = 2
$$  

Step 1: Add both equations  
$$
(x + y) + (x - y) = 10 + 2 \\
2x = 12 \\
x = 6
$$  

Step 2: Substitute $$ x = 6 $$  
$$
6 + y = 10 \\
y = 4
$$  

**Final Answer:**  
$$
(6,\;4)
$$

### ✅ Example 3: Multiplication Required ✖️✖️  

Solve:  
$$
3x + 2y = 11 \\
4x + 2y = 14
$$  

Step 1: Subtract equations  
$$
(4x + 2y) - (3x + 2y) = 14 - 11 \\
x = 3
$$  

Step 2: Substitute $$ x = 3 $$  
$$
3(3) + 2y = 11 \\
9 + 2y = 11 \\
2y = 2 \\
y = 1
$$  

**Final Answer:**  
$$
(3,\;1)
$$

## 🔹 2. MATRIX METHOD – DEFINITION & DETAILED EXPLANATION 📊  

### ✅ Definition  
The **matrix method** is a powerful technique in which a system of linear equations is represented using **matrices** and solved by:  
- Finding the **inverse of a matrix**, or  
- Using **row operations (Gauss or Gauss–Jordan elimination)**.

### 📐 Matrix Representation  

Given the system  
$$
ax + by = c \\
dx + ey = f
$$  

It is written in matrix form as:  
$$
AX = B
$$  

Where  
$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
d & e
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
B =
\begin{bmatrix}
c \\
f
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

If the inverse of $A$ exists, then  
$$
X = A^{-1}B
$$  

### ⭐ Importance  
- Efficient for **large systems**  
- Used in **AI 🤖, machine learning, engineering design, and scientific computing**  
- Helps determine **rank, consistency, and nature of solutions**

### ✅ Example 1: Inverse Matrix Method  

Solve:  
$$
x + y = 5 \\
2x + 3y = 11
$$  

Coefficient and constant matrices:  
$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}

2 & 3
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
B =
\begin{bmatrix}
5 \\
11
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

Determinant:  
$$
|A| = (1)(3) - (1)(2) = 1
$$  

Inverse of $A$:  
$$
A^{-1} =
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & -1 \\
-2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

Solution using $$ X = A^{-1}B $$  
$$
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & -1 \\
-2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
5 \\
11
\end{bmatrix}

### ✅ Example 2: Augmented Matrix (Gauss Method)  

Solve:  
$$
x + 2y = 7 \\
3x + 2y = 11
$$  

Augmented matrix:  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & \mid & 7 \\
3 & 2 & \mid & 11
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

Row operation $$ R_2 \to R_2 - 3R_1 $$:  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & \mid & 7 \\
0 & -4 & \mid & -10
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

Solve for $y$:  
$$
y = \frac{-10}{-4} = \frac{5}{2}
$$  

Substitute in the first equation:  
$$
x + 2\left(\frac{5}{2}\right) = 7 \\
x = 2
$$  

**Answer:**  
$$
(2,\;\tfrac{5}{2})
$$

### ✅ Example 3: No Solution Case ❌  

Solve:  
$$
2x + y = 4 \\
4x + 2y = 10
$$  

Augmented matrix:  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 & \mid & 4 \\
4 & 2 & \mid & 10
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

Row operation $$ R_2 \to R_2 - 2R_1 $$:  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 & \mid & 4 \\
0 & 0 & \mid & 2
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

This gives:  
$$
0x + 0y = 2
$$  

**Conclusion:** No solution → Parallel lines
