## 🔷 **1. Linear Dependence** 🔗

### ✅ **Detailed Definition (80+ Words)**

A set of vectors is said to be **linearly dependent** if **at least one vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors**. In simple words, this means that one vector is **not unique** and does **not add any new direction or information** to the set. Mathematically, vectors (\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_n) are linearly dependent if there exist **constants, not all zero**, such that
[
c_1\vec{v}_1 + c_2\vec{v}_2 + \cdots + c_n\vec{v}_n = \vec{0}
]
where at least one (c_i \neq 0). Linear dependence indicates **redundancy in data**, and it is commonly seen when vectors are **parallel, proportional, or repeated**. This concept is very important in **matrices, systems of equations, rank, and vector spaces**.

### ✅ **Geometric Visual Representation (Text-Based)**

```
v₁ ─────────▶
v₂ ─────────▶   (Same direction → Dependent)
```

or

```
v₂ = 2v₁  ✅
```

This shows **one vector is just a scaled version of another**.

## 🟢 **Basic Examples of Linear Dependence**

### ✅ **Example 1 (Proportional Vectors – 2D)**

[
\vec{v}_1 = (2, 4), \quad \vec{v}_2 = (1, 2)
]

**Steps 🔹**

* ((2,4) = 2(1,2))
* One vector is a **multiple of the other**

✅ **Conclusion:**
Vectors are **linearly dependent**

---

### ✅ **Example 2 (Repeated Vectors)**

[
\vec{v}_1 = (3, -2), \quad \vec{v}_2 = (3, -2)
]

**Steps 🔹**

* Both vectors are **identical**
* One can be written directly from the other

✅ **Conclusion:**
Vectors are **linearly dependent**

### ✅ **Example 3 (Three Vectors – One is a Combination)**

[
\vec{v}_1 = (1, 1), \quad \vec{v}_2 = (2, 2), \quad \vec{v}_3 = (3, 3)
]

**Steps 🔹**

* (\vec{v}_2 = 2\vec{v}_1)
* (\vec{v}_3 = 3\vec{v}_1)
* All lie on the **same straight line**

✅ **Conclusion:**
The set is **linearly dependent**

### 📝 **Key Features of Linear Dependence**

✅ At least one vector is redundant
✅ Vectors lie on the **same line or plane**
✅ Determinant = 0 (for square matrices)
✅ Rank is **less than number of vectors**

## 🔷 **2. Linear Independence** 🧩

---

### ✅ **Detailed Definition (80+ Words)**

A set of vectors is said to be **linearly independent** if **none of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others**. This means that **each vector adds a new direction or new information** to the set. Mathematically, vectors (\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_n) are linearly independent if the equation
[
c_1\vec{v}_1 + c_2\vec{v}_2 + \cdots + c_n\vec{v}_n = \vec{0}
]
has **only the trivial solution**
[
c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0
]
Linear independence means **no vector is redundant**. This concept is fundamental in **basis, dimension, rank of a matrix, systems of equations, engineering, physics, AI, and data science**.

### ✅ **Geometric Visual Representation (Text-Based)**

```
v₁ ─────▶
        ↗ v₂
(Non-parallel → Independent)
```

or in 3D:

```
x → , y ↑ , z ⤴  
All directions different
```

### ✅ **Example 1 (Standard Unit Vectors – 2D)**

[
\vec{i} = (1, 0), \quad \vec{j} = (0, 1)
]

**Steps 🔹**

* No scalar multiple of ((1,0)) gives ((0,1))
* Directions are **perpendicular**

✅ **Conclusion:**
Vectors are **linearly independent**

### ✅ **Example 2 (Non-Proportional Vectors – 2D)**

[
\vec{v}_1 = (1, 2), \quad \vec{v}_2 = (3, 4)
]

**Steps 🔹**

* ((1,2)) is **not** a multiple of ((3,4))
* Ratios:
  (\frac{1}{3} \neq \frac{2}{4})

✅ **Conclusion:**
Vectors are **linearly independent**

---

### ✅ **Example 3 (Three Independent Vectors – 3D)**

[
\vec{i}=(1,0,0), \quad \vec{j}=(0,1,0), \quad \vec{k}=(0,0,1)
]

**Steps 🔹**

* None can be formed using the other two
* All lie along **different axes**

✅ **Conclusion:**
The vectors are **linearly independent**
