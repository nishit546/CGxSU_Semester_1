## 🔷 1. Definition of Rank of a Matrix

### ✅ Meaning & Definition

- 📌 The **rank of a matrix** is defined as the **maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns** in the matrix.
- 📌 It represents the **true size or effective information** contained in the matrix.
- 📌 If some rows or columns are repeated or can be formed using others, they are called **dependent** and are **not counted** in rank.

📌 **In simple words:** Rank tells us **how many rows or columns actually give new information**.

---

### 1. Basic Bound

```
Rank(A) ≤ min(number of rows, number of columns)
```

### 2. Zero Matrix

```
Rank of zero matrix = 0
```

### 3. Row vs Column

```
Rank obtained from rows = Rank obtained from columns
```

### 4. Full Rank

* If all rows (or columns) are independent:

```
Rank = min(rows, columns)
```

* Unit (identity) matrix of order m:

```
Rank = m
```

### 5. Square Matrix & Determinant

* If A is n×n and |A| ≠ 0:

```
Rank(A) = n
```

* If A is n×n and |A| = 0:

```
Rank(A) < n
```

### 6. Applications of Rank

* Solving linear equations
* Finding inverse of a matrix
* Checking consistency of a system
* Determining vector independence

## 🟢 Examples Based on Definition

### ✅ Example 1

A = [1 2]
[3 4]

- No row is a multiple of another  
- Both rows are independent  
- Number of independent rows = 2  

✅ **Rank(A) = 2**

---

### ✅ Example 2

B = [2 4]
[1 2]

- Row 1 = 2 × Row 2  
- Only **one independent row** exists  
- One row is dependent  

✅ **Rank(B) = 1**

---

### ✅ Example 3

C = [0 0]
[0 0]

- All elements are zero  
- No independent row  

✅ **Rank(C) = 0**

---

### 📝 Conclusion from Definition
- ✅ More independent rows → Higher rank  
- ✅ Repeated or dependent rows → Lower rank  
- ✅ Zero matrix → Zero rank

## 🔷 2. Computation of Rank of a Matrix (Using Row Echelon Form)

### ✅ Main Idea
- 📌 To compute the rank, **convert the matrix into Row Echelon Form (REF)** using **elementary row operations**, then **count the non-zero rows**.

---

# 📘 Row Echelon Form (REF) — Rules

---

## ✅ Definition

A matrix is said to be in **Row Echelon Form (REF)** if it satisfies the following rules.

---

## 🔹 Rules of Row Echelon Form

### ✔️ Rule 1: Zero Rows at the Bottom
- Any row consisting entirely of zeros must be placed **below all non-zero rows**.

---

### ✔️ Rule 2: Position of Leading Entries (Staircase Rule)
- In each non-zero row, the **first non-zero element** (called the **leading entry or pivot**) must appear **to the right of the leading entry in the row above it**.
- This creates a **step-like (staircase) pattern** from left to right.

---

### ✔️ Rule 3: Zeros Below Leading Entries
- All elements **below each leading entry** must be **zero**.

---

## 📌 Important Notes

- The leading entry **does NOT have to be 1**.
- Negative numbers or fractions are allowed as leading entries.
- Only **row operations** are used to convert a matrix into REF.

---

## 🧠 One-Line Memory Trick

> **REF = Right-moving pivots with zeros below**

---

### ✅ Elementary Row Operations
- 🔁 Interchange two rows  
- ✖️ Multiply a row by a non-zero constant  
- ➕ Add a multiple of one row to another row  

---

### ✅ Rule to Find Rank
🎯 **Rank = Total number of non-zero rows in Row Echelon Form**

---

## 🟢 Solved Examples on Computation (Step-by-Step)

### ✅ Example 1 (2×2 matrix)

A = [1 2]
[2 4]

**Step 1:** R2 → R2 - 2·R1

[1 2]
[0 0]

**Step 2:** Count non-zero rows = 1  

✅ **Rank(A) = 1**

---

### ✅ Example 2 (3×3 matrix, all rows multiples)

B = [1 2 3]
[2 4 6]
[3 6 9]


**Step 1:**  
- R2 → R2 - 2·R1  
- R3 → R3 - 3·R1

[1 2 3]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]


**Step 2:** Only one non-zero row  

✅ **Rank(B) = 1**

---

### ✅ Example 3 (3×3 matrix, partially dependent)

C = [1 2 3]
[2 3 4]
[3 4 5]

**Step 1:**  
- R2 → R2 - 2·R1  
- R3 → R3 - 3·R1

[1 2 3]
[0 -1 -2]
[0 -2 -4]


**Step 2:**  
- R3 → R3 - 2·R2

[1 2 3]
[0 -1 -2]
[0 0 0]

**Step 3:** Count non-zero rows = 2  

✅ **Rank(C) = 2**

---

### ✅ Example 4 (Rectangular 3×2 matrix)

D = [1 2]
[2 4]
[3 6]


- All rows are multiples of the first row  
- Only one independent row  

✅ **Rank(D) = 1**

✅ **Rank(D) = 1**
