
# 🕸️ **Graph Representations**

Graphs can be represented in various ways for storage and processing in computer memory.
The two most commonly used methods are:

1. 🧮 **Adjacency Matrix Representation**
2. 📜 **Adjacency List Representation**

Each method has its own importance, advantages, and applications based on whether the graph is **dense** or **sparse**.

---

## 🟩 **1. Adjacency Matrix Representation** 🧮

An **Adjacency Matrix** is a **2D array (matrix)** used to represent the connection between vertices in a graph.

* Each **row and column** of the matrix represents a **vertex**.
* The value in a cell `(i, j)` indicates whether an edge exists between vertex `i` and vertex `j`.

👉 For **unweighted graphs**:

* `1` → edge exists
* `0` → no edge

👉 For **weighted graphs**:

* Each cell stores the **weight** of the edge instead of `1` or `0`.

📈 This representation is ideal for **dense graphs**, where the number of edges is close to the maximum possible.
It also allows **O(1)** edge lookup time — meaning you can check connections instantly ⚡.

### 🌿 **Visual Representation**

Consider this undirected graph:

```
     (A)
     / \
   (B)-(C)
```

### 🔹 **Vertices:** {A, B, C}

### 🔹 **Edges:** {A-B, A-C, B-C}

|       | A | B | C |
| ----- | - | - | - |
| **A** | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| **B** | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| **C** | 1 | 1 | 0 |

✅ The matrix is **symmetric** because the graph is **undirected**.

---

### ⚙️ **Properties**

1. Matrix dimension is always `V × V`.
2. For undirected graphs, it’s symmetric along the diagonal.
3. For directed graphs, it’s not necessarily symmetric.
4. Weighted graphs store edge weights instead of `1`.
5. Requires `O(V²)` space complexity.

| **B** | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| **C** | 0 | 1 | 0 |

### 🔵 **Example 2: Directed Graph**

**Graph:**

```

↑       |
└───────┘
```

|       | A | B | C |

### ⚠️ **Disadvantages**

❌ Requires O(V²) space
❌ Inefficient for sparse graphs

## 🟦 **2. Adjacency List Representation** 📜

The **Adjacency List** is a **collection of lists**, where:

* Each **vertex** has a **list of its neighbors** (adjacent vertices).
* Each list may be implemented using **arrays**, **linked lists**, or **maps**.

👉 Efficient for **sparse graphs** with fewer edges, as it only stores existing connections.
👉 Space complexity = **O(V + E)**.
