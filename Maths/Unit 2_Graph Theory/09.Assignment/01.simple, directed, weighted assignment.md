### Q1. 🔹

Figure:

```
A ----- B
|       |
|       |
D ----- C
```

**(i)** Type: **Simple graph** (undirected, no weights shown). ✅
**(ii)** Vertices (V={A,B,C,D}). Edges (E={{A,B},{B,C},{C,D},{D,A}}).
Degrees: (deg(A)=2,,deg(B)=2,,deg(C)=2,,deg(D)=2). 🔷

---

### Q2. 🔹

Figure:

```
A → B → C
↑     ↓
D ← E
```

**(i)** Directed edges (list): (A!\to!B,;B!\to!C,;E!\to!D,;D!\to!A,;C!\to!E). *(Assumed (C\to E) from downward arrow.)*
**(ii)** For vertex (C): **in-degree** = 1 (from (B)), **out-degree** = 1 (to (E)). 🎯

---

### Q3. 🔹 (Weighted)

Figure:

```
A --2-- B --3-- C
|               |
4               6
|               |
D -----5------ E
```

**(i)** Type: **Weighted graph**.
**(ii)** Path weight (A\to B\to C\to E = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11). 💲

---

### Q4. 🔹

Figure:

```
P --- Q
|   / |
|  /  |
R --- S
```

**(i)** Yes — **simple graph** (no directions/weights).
**(ii)** Example cycle: (P!-!Q!-!S!-!R!-!P). (There are several 3- and 4-cycles depending on edges shown; one 4-cycle given.) 🔁

---

### Q5. 🔹 (Directed, path validity)

Figure:

```
1 → 2 → 3
↑     ↓
4 ← 5
```

Edges (assumed): (1\to2,;2\to3,;4\to1,;3\to5,;5\to4).
Is path (4\to1\to2\to3\to5) valid? **Yes** — all those directed edges exist as listed. ✅

---

### Q6. 🔹 (Weighted shortest-path)

Figure:

```
M --8-- N
|      /
2     / 7
|   /
O --5-- P
```

Edges: (M!-!N(8),;M!-!O(2),;O!-!P(5),;N!-!P(7)).
**(i)** Weights incident on (O): (2) (to (M)), (5) (to (P)).
**(ii)** Shortest path (M\to P): compare (M!-!O!-!P=2+5=7) and (M!-!N!-!P=8+7=15). **Shortest = (M!-!O!-!P) with weight 7.** 🏁

---

### Q7. 🔹 (Identify type)

Figure:

```
U ⇄ V
|     \
|      \
W ----> X
```

Interpretation: (U \leftrightarrow V) suggests **mutual directed edges** between (U) and (V) (i.e., two directed edges). (W\to X) shown and (W!-!U) undirected/unknown.
**Answer:** This is a **directed graph** (digraph) because arrows are shown; not purely simple. If the link (U\leftrightarrow V) is two opposite directed edges, it’s directed; if weights were present it would be weighted. Justification: presence of arrowheads → **directed**. 🡒🡐

### Q8. 🔹 (Simple graph – degree)

Figure:

```
L --- M --- N
 \         /
   \     /
      O
```

Assume undirected edges: (L!-!M,;M!-!N,;L!-!O,;O!-!N).
Degrees: (deg(L)=2) (to (M,O)); (deg(M)=2) (to (L,N)); (deg(N)=2) (to (M,O)); (deg(O)=2) (to (L,N)). ✔

---

### Q9. 🔹 (Directed degree table)

Figure:

```
A → B → D
↓     ↑
C ----
```

Assumptions: edges (A\to B,;B\to D,;A\to C,;C\to B).
Table (vertex : in-degree, out-degree):

* (A:) in 0, out 2 ((A\to B,;A\to C)).
* (B:) in 2 ((A,;C)), out 1 ((B\to D)).
* (C:) in 1 (from (A)? we assumed (A\to C)), out 1 ((C\to B)).
* (D:) in 1 (from (B)), out 0.
  Directed cycles? There is no directed cycle of length >1 under these assumed edges (A→B→D does not return to A). If instead there's an edge (D\to A) then (A\to B\to D\to A) would be a cycle — check diagram in class. 🔎

---

### Q10. 🔹 (Weighted cycle)

Figure:

```
X --4-- Y
|       |
9       6
|       |
Z --3-- W
```

Edges: (X!-!Y(4),;Y!-!W(6),;W!-!Z(3),;Z!-!X(9)).
**(i)** Weight of cycle (X\to Y\to W\to Z\to X = 4 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 22.)**
**(ii)** Is the graph complete? **No.** (A complete graph on 4 vertices would have all (\binom{4}{2}=6) edges — here e.g., (X!-!W) and (Y!-!Z) are missing.) ❌

---

### Q11. 🔹 (Directed strong connectivity)

Figure:

```
S → T → U
↑     ↓
R ← ← V
```

Interpretation (assumed): edges (S\to T,;T\to U,;U\to V,;V\to R,;R\to S).
**(i)** Vertices with out-degree ≥ 2: count depends on actual arrows; under assumed edges none have out-degree ≥2 (all have out-degree 1). If the diagram actually shows extra arrows from (T) etc., update accordingly.
**(ii)** Strongly connected? **No** under this assumed structure — strong connectivity means every vertex reachable from every other following directions; here, not all backward paths exist. (If all directed cycles exist connecting them, then yes; check real diagram.) 🔁❌

---

### Q12. 🔹 (Weighted — shortest path)

Figure:

```
1 --10-- 2 --1-- 3
|               |
4              2
|               |
5 -----8------ 4
```

**(Assumption)** (read numbers adjacent): edges and weights:
(1!-!2(10),;2!-!3(1),;3!-!4(2),;1!-!4(4),;4!-!5(8)).
**(i)** Shortest path (1\to3): compare (1!-!2!-!3=10+1=11) and (1!-!4!-!3=4+2=6). **Shortest = (1!-!4!-!3) with weight 6.**
**(ii)** Total weight = 6. 🧭

---

### Q13. 🔹 (Mixed identification)

Figure:

```
B --3-- C
↑       ↓
A       D
```

**(i)** Interpret edges: (B!-!C(3)) is weighted (undirected). (A\to B) (directed up arrow). (C\to D) (directed down arrow). So graph contains **mixed** types: both directed edges and at least one weighted undirected edge.
**(ii)** Count weighted edges: **1** (the (B!-!C) edge with weight 3) as shown.

---

### Q14. 🔹 (Simple graph — edge set & planarity)

Figure:

```
H --- I
| \   |
|  \  |
J --- K
```

**(i)** Edge set (E={{H,I},{H,J},{H,K},{I,K},{J,K}}).
**(ii)** Is it planar? **Yes.** This graph can be drawn without crossing edges (it’s a 4- or 5-vertex graph that’s not (K_5) or (K_{3,3})); with suitable layout it’s planar. 📐

---

### Q15. 🔹 (Weighted path comparison)

Figure:

```
P --4-- Q --7-- R
|       \
2        \ 3
|         \
S ----6---- T
```

Edges: (P!-!Q(4),;Q!-!R(7),;P!-!S(2),;S!-!T(6),;T!-!R(3),;Q!-!T(3)).
**(i-a)** Path cost (P\to Q\to R = 4 + 7 = 11.)
**(i-b)** Path cost (P\to S\to T\to R = 2 + 6 + 3 = 11.)
**(ii)** Both paths cost **11** — **tie**. If asked, you can show both and mention tie. ⚖️
