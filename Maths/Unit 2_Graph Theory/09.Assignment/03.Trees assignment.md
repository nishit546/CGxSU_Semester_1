### **Q3️⃣**

Determine whether the tree below is a **full binary tree**.
Justify your answer. 🔍

```
     R
   /   \
  S     T
       / \
      U   V
```

### **Q5️⃣**

Check if the below tree is a **complete binary tree**:

```
     A
   /   \
  B     C
 / \
D   E
```

Reason clearly. 📝

### **Q6️⃣**

Create any example of **almost complete binary tree** with **5 nodes** and label levels.
🎨 Show the missing node in between last level.

---

### **Q7️⃣**

Given the tree:

```
   X
  /
 Y
/ \
Z  W
```

a) Total number of nodes
b) Degree of X, Y, Z
c) Leaves count 🍃

---

### **Q8️⃣**

Consider the binary tree below:

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   /
  4   5 6
```

Is it **complete** or **almost complete**?
Explain your answer.

### **Q9️⃣**

How many **edges** exist in a tree having 12 vertices?
📌 Formula: (E = V - 1)

---

### **Q🔟**

Draw a **binary tree** where the height = **3**
and number of nodes = **5–7**.
Label the levels 0, 1, 2, 3.

---

### **Q1️⃣1️⃣**

Determine whether the given binary structure is valid:

```
    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \
D   E
 \
  F
```

Explain if every node has ≤ 2 children. ⚠️

---

### **Q1️⃣2️⃣**

Convert the following **general tree** into a **binary tree** mapping:
(Use left-child right-sibling method) 🔁

```
A
├─B
├─C
└─D
```

---

### **Q1️⃣3️⃣**

State whether:
a) Every **full binary tree** is **complete**
b) Every **complete binary tree** is **full**
Give one example each (diagram). 🧠

### **Q1️⃣4️⃣**

Find height and level of nodes A, D, G in the tree:

```
       A
     /   \
    B     C
   / \
  D   E
     /
    G
```

---

### **Q1️⃣5️⃣**

Identify the type of binary tree and justify:

```
   P
  / \
 Q   R
/
S
```

✔ Full?
✔ Complete?
✔ Almost complete?
Explain with properties used. 📌
