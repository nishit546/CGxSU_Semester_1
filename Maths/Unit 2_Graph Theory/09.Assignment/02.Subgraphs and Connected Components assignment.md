### **Q1️⃣ – Subgraph Construction**

Consider the graph (G):

```
   A — B — C
   |     /
   D — E
```

a) Draw a **subgraph H** by removing vertices {C, E}
b) Write **V(H)** and **E(H)**

---

### **Q2️⃣ – Connected Components**

```
P --- Q      R --- S
```

(i) How many **connected components** are present?
(ii) Write vertices in each component

---

### **Q3️⃣ – Connectivity Check**

```
1 — 2 — 3      4 — 5
```

Is the graph **connected** or **disconnected**?
If disconnected, write **number of components**

---

### **Q4️⃣ – Subgraph Examples**

```
P — Q — R — S
```

Find **two different subgraphs**
Write vertices & edges in each subgraph

---

### **Q5️⃣ – Identify Connected Components**

```
A      B — C — D
```

Write all connected components in **set notation**

---

### **Q6️⃣ – Draw & Identify**

Given:
E = {(A,B), (B,C), (C,A), (D,E)}

Draw the graph (G) and count **connected components**

---

### **Q7️⃣ – Proper Subgraph**

```
X — Y — Z — W
```

Draw a **proper subgraph** by removing at least one
vertex **and** one edge

---

### **Q8️⃣ – Subgraph Validation**

Original Graph:
Vertices = {1,2,3,4}
Edges = {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)}

Proposed Subgraph:
Vertices = {1,2,3}
Edges = {(1,2), (1,3)}

Is this a **valid subgraph**?
Give justification

---

### **Q9️⃣ – Connected Components Count**

```
  A — B     C — D — E     F
```

Find number of connected components with reasoning

---

### **Q🔟 – Subgraphs (2 Vertices Only)**

```
M — N — O
```

Draw all possible **subgraphs containing exactly 2 vertices**

---

### **Q1️⃣1️⃣ – Connecting Graph Components**

A graph has **three connected components**

Is it possible to add exactly **two edges** to make entire graph connected?
Explain with a figure

### **Q1️⃣2️⃣ – Connectivity in Subgraph**

Choose vertices {P, Q, S} from:

```
P — Q — R — S — T
```

Draw induced subgraph
State whether it is **connected** or **disconnected**
