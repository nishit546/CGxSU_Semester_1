Graphs are a fundamental concept in **Discrete Mathematics** and **Computer Science**, representing relationships or connections between objects.
They are denoted as **G(V, E)** — where **V** is the set of vertices (nodes) and **E** is the set of edges (connections).
Let’s explore three main types of graphs with visuals, examples, and clear understanding.

---

## 🟦 **1. Simple Graph**

### 🧩 **Definition:**

A **Simple Graph** is a graph where:

* No vertex is connected to itself (**no self-loop**)
* No two vertices are connected by more than one edge (**no parallel edges**)
* All edges are **undirected** (no arrows) and **unweighted** (no values)

Formally written as **G = (V, E)** where edges only represent **mutual** relationships.
It’s the most basic type of graph used for clear and symmetric connections.

### 💡 **Visual Representation:**

```
   (A) —— (B)
    |       |
    |       |
   (C) —— (D)
```

Here, A, B, C, and D are vertices connected by simple edges (no directions, no loops).

---

### 🔍 **Concept Summary:**

A Simple Graph models **equal, two-way relationships** such as friendships or basic network links. It focuses only on *connection existence*, not intensity or direction.

---

### 🧠 **6 Detailed Examples of Simple Graphs:**

1. **👫 Friendship Network:**

   * Vertices → People
   * Edges → Friendships (mutual)
     ✅ Example: A—B (A and B are friends)

2. **🛣️ Road Map (Unweighted):**

   * Cities → Vertices
   * Roads → Edges
   * Focus: Whether cities are connected, not how far.

3. **💻 Computer Network (Topology):**

   * Computers (vertices) connected via cables (edges).
   * Only connectivity is shown, not data rate.

4. **🏫 Classroom Relationship Graph:**

   * Students connected if they are in the same group/project.

5. **🏢 Organization Collaboration Chart:**

   * Employees (nodes) connected if they work on the same team.

6. **🔢 Number Graph:**

   * Vertices = {1, 2, 3, 4},
   * Edge if difference = 1 → {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)}

### 🧾 **Key Takeaways:**

* ❌ No loops
* ❌ No direction
* ❌ No weights
* ✅ Ideal for symmetric relationships

## 🟩 **2. Directed Graph (Digraph)**

### 🧩 **Definition:**

A **Directed Graph (Digraph)** is a graph where **each edge has a direction**, represented by an arrow (→).
Edges are **ordered pairs (u, v)** showing a one-way connection from vertex **u to v**.

Formally: **G = (V, E)**, where every edge shows a **directed relationship**.

---

### 💡 **Visual Representation:**

```
   (A) → (B)
     ↑     ↓
     (D) ← (C)
```

Each arrow represents a one-way relationship, e.g., A→B means “A influences B” but not vice versa.

---

### 🔍 **Concept Summary:**

Directed graphs represent **asymmetric** relationships such as one-way links, commands, or dependencies.
They’re widely used in **web graphs**, **data flow**, **dependency management**, and **social media follow systems**.

---

### 🧠 **6 Detailed Examples of Directed Graphs:**

1. **🐦 Twitter Network:**

   * (A→B) means A follows B (not necessarily mutual).

2. **🌐 Web Page Linking:**

   * If page A links to B, edge = (A→B).
   * Used in Google’s **PageRank Algorithm**.

3. **📚 Course Prerequisites:**

   * (Math → Physics) means you must complete Math before Physics.

4. **⚙️ File Dependency:**

   * (File1 → File2) means File1 depends on File2 to run.

5. **🚦 Traffic Flow (One-Way Roads):**

   * A→B means traffic can only move from A to B.

6. **🧭 Workflow Process:**

   * Each step leads to the next (Step1 → Step2 → Step3).

### 🧾 **Key Takeaways:**

* ➡️ Has direction
* 🔁 Can include self-loops
* ⚙️ Represents one-way processes
* 🧭 Common in flowcharts, control flow, and data pipelines

## 🟥 **3. Weighted Graph**

### 🧩 **Definition:**

A **Weighted Graph** is a graph where each edge has a **weight (value)** associated with it.
The weight represents **distance**, **time**, **cost**, or **capacity** between two vertices.

Edges can be **directed** or **undirected** depending on the relationship type.

---

### 💡 **Visual Representation:**

```
     (A)
     /  \
   4/    \2
   /      \
 (B)——3——(C)
```

Here,

* Edge A–B = weight 4
* Edge A–C = weight 2
* Edge B–C = weight 3

---

### 🔍 **Concept Summary:**

Weighted graphs are essential in **optimization problems**, where we need to find the **shortest path**, **minimum cost**, or **maximum capacity**.
Algorithms like **Dijkstra’s** and **Kruskal’s** are applied to such graphs.

---

### 🧠 **6 Detailed Examples of Weighted Graphs:**

1. **🗺️ Road Map (Distance):**

   * Vertices = Cities
   * Edge weights = Distance (km)
     ✅ Example: A—B = 120 km, A—C = 200 km

2. **✈️ Airline Route Graph:**

   * Airports as nodes, weights = ticket prices or flight duration.

3. **💡 Power Grid:**

   * Power stations connected by wires with weights = energy loss or cost.

4. **📦 Supply Chain Network:**

   * Warehouses and stores with weights = transportation cost.

5. **🌐 Internet Network:**

   * Servers as vertices, weights = latency (ms) or bandwidth (Mbps).

6. **💬 Social Influence Graph:**

   * Users as nodes, edge weights = level of trust or frequency of communication.

---

### 🧾 **Key Takeaways:**

* ⚖️ Each edge has a measurable value (weight)
* 🔁 Can be directed or undirected
* 🧮 Used for shortest path, minimum cost, or efficiency problems
