# 📘 TYPES OF GRAPHS

Graphs are fundamental structures in **Discrete Mathematics** and **Computer Science**, used to represent relationships or connections between objects.
Depending on the nature of these connections (edges), graphs can be classified into various types.
The most common and foundational types are:

1. 🟦 **Simple Graph**
2. 🟩 **Directed Graph (Digraph)**
3. 🟨 **Weighted Graph**

---

## 🟦 1. SIMPLE GRAPH

A **Simple Graph** is an **undirected graph** that contains **no loops** (an edge connecting a vertex to itself) and **no multiple edges** between the same pair of vertices.
Each edge represents a **mutual relationship**, where connections are bidirectional.

### 🧠 **Detailed Explanation**

Formally,
A simple graph is denoted as ( G = (V, E) ), where:

* ( V ): Set of vertices
* ( E ): Set of **unordered pairs** of distinct vertices
* There are **no loops** or **parallel edges**

These graphs represent symmetric relationships, such as **friendships**, **road networks**, or **peer-to-peer connections**.

### 🎨 **Visual Representation**

```
   (A) ----- (B)
    |         |
    |         |
   (C) ----- (D)
```

Here:
V = {A, B, C, D}
E = {(A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (C, D)}

---

### 📘 **Examples of Simple Graph**

#### 🧩 **Example 1: Friendship Network**

* Vertices: Students = {A, B, C, D}
* Edges: {(A, B), (A, C), (B, D)}
  🔹 A is friends with B and C, and B is friends with D.
  ✅ **Answer:** No loops or repeated edges → *Simple Graph.*

---

#### 🛣️ **Example 2: Road Map**

* Cities: {X, Y, Z}
* Roads: {(X, Y), (Y, Z)}
  🔹 Each road connects two cities in both directions.
  ✅ *Undirected, hence Simple Graph.*

---

#### 💬 **Example 3: Social Media Friendships**

* Users: {P, Q, R, S}
* Edges: {(P, Q), (Q, R), (R, S)}
  🔹 Each friendship is mutual.
  ✅ *Simple Graph.*

---

#### 💻 **Example 4: Computer LAN Network**

* Computers: {C1, C2, C3, C4}
* Connections: {(C1, C2), (C2, C3), (C3, C4)}
  ✅ *Undirected connections → Simple Graph.*

---

#### 🧍‍♂️ **Example 5: Classroom Seating**

* Students sitting beside each other: {(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)}
  ✅ *No loops → Simple Graph.*

---

#### ⚽ **Example 6: Team Communication**

* Players: {P1, P2, P3, P4}
* Links: {(P1, P2), (P2, P3), (P3, P4)}
  ✅ *Equal two-way communication → Simple Graph.*

---

## 🟩 2. DIRECTED GRAPH (DIGRAPH)

A **Directed Graph (Digraph)** is a type of graph where the **edges have directions**.
Each edge represents a one-way relationship, meaning if an edge goes from vertex A to vertex B, it doesn’t necessarily go back from B to A.

### 🧠 **Detailed Explanation**

A directed graph is represented as ( G = (V, E) ), where:

* ( V ): Set of vertices
* ( E ): Set of **ordered pairs** of vertices (A, B), indicating a direction A → B

Directed graphs represent **asymmetric relationships**, such as **follower relationships**, **website links**, or **task dependencies**.

### 🎨 **Visual Representation**

```
   (A) ---> (B)
     ^        |
     |        v
    (D) <--- (C)
```

Here:
V = {A, B, C, D}
E = {(A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A)}

---

### 📘 **Examples of Directed Graph**

#### 🐦 **Example 1: Twitter Following**

* Users: {A, B, C}
* Edges: (A → B), (B → C)
  ✅ A follows B, B follows C — not vice versa → *Directed Graph.*

---

#### ⏳ **Example 2: Task Scheduling**

* Tasks: {T1, T2, T3}
* Dependencies: (T1 → T2), (T2 → T3)
  ✅ Tasks must follow a sequence → *Directed Graph.*

---

#### 🌐 **Example 3: Website Links**

* Pages: {P1, P2, P3}
* Links: (P1 → P2), (P2 → P3), (P3 → P1)
  ✅ One-way linking → *Directed Graph.*

---

#### 🏢 **Example 4: Organizational Hierarchy**

* Manager–Employee relation: (Manager → Employee)
* (A → B), (A → C), (B → D)
  ✅ One-directional authority → *Directed Graph.*

---

#### ⚡ **Example 5: Electric Flow**

* Nodes: {N1, N2, N3}
* Current flow: (N1 → N2), (N2 → N3)
  ✅ Current moves one way → *Directed Graph.*

---

#### 📡 **Example 6: Data Transfer System**

* Systems: {S1, S2, S3}
* Transfers: (S1 → S2), (S2 → S3)
  ✅ One-way transmission → *Directed Graph.*

## 🟨 3. WEIGHTED GRAPH

A **Weighted Graph** is a graph where each edge carries a **numerical value (weight)**.
This weight represents cost, distance, time, or any measurable quantity associated with that connection.

### 🧠 **Detailed Explanation**

A weighted graph is represented as ( G = (V, E, W) ), where:

* ( V ): Set of vertices
* ( E ): Set of edges
* ( W ): Weight function assigning a real number to each edge

Weighted graphs are widely used in **network optimization**, **shortest path problems**, and **resource allocation**.

### 🎨 **Visual Representation**

```
       (A)
      /   \
   4 /     \ 2
    /       \
  (B)---3---(C)
```

Here:
E = {(A, B, 4), (A, C, 2), (B, C, 3)}
Each edge’s number represents its **weight**.

### 📘 **Examples of Weighted Graph**

#### 🚗 **Example 1: City Distance Map**

* Cities: {A, B, C}
* Distances: (A, B, 5 km), (B, C, 7 km), (A, C, 3 km)

#### ✈️ **Example 2: Flight Fare Network**

* Airports: {X, Y, Z}
* Fares: (X, Y, ₹5000), (Y, Z, ₹6000)

* Routers: {R1, R2, R3}
* Latency: (R1, R2, 10ms), (R2, R3, 15ms)
