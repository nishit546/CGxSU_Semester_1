---

## 🟩 1. **Definition of Tree** 🌿

A **Tree** is a special type of graph that is **connected** and **acyclic** (contains no loops).
Formally, a tree is defined as:

> **T = (V, E)**, where
>
> * **V** → set of vertices (nodes)
> * **E** → set of edges (connections between vertices)

For a tree having `n` vertices, the total number of edges is always **n - 1**.
If you remove any edge, the graph becomes **disconnected**, and if you add one more edge, it forms a **cycle**.

🧩 **Real-Life Examples:**

* 📁 File Directory Structure
* 👨‍👩‍👧 Family Tree
* 🏢 Company Hierarchy
* 🌐 Internet Domain Structure
* 🧠 Decision Trees in AI
* 📞 Telephone Network Connection

### 🌳 **Visual Representation**

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \   \
    D   E   F
```

👉 **Explanation:**

* Vertices = {A, B, C, D, E, F}
* Edges = 5 → satisfies rule `n - 1 = 6 - 1`
* Connected ✅
* No cycles ✅

Hence, it is a **Tree** 🌲

---

### 📘 **Key Characteristics:**

1. Connected and acyclic graph ✅
2. For `n` vertices → always `n-1` edges ✅
3. Only one path exists between any two vertices ✅
4. Removing an edge disconnects the tree ✅
5. Adding an edge creates exactly one cycle ✅

---

### 🧮 **6 Practical Examples on Tree Definition**

#### 🧠 **Example 1:**

Vertices = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Edges = {(1,2), (1,3), (3,4), (4,5)}
✅ `Edges = 5 - 1 = 4`, Connected, No cycles
✅ **Hence, it is a Tree**

```
1
├── 2
└── 3
    └── 4
        └── 5
```

---

#### 🧠 **Example 2:**

Vertices = {A, B, C, D}
Edges = {(A,B), (B,C), (C,D), (D,A)}
❌ Contains a cycle A→B→C→D→A
❌ **Not a Tree**

---

#### 🧠 **Example 3:**

Vertices = {P, Q, R, S, T}
Edges = {(P,Q), (Q,R), (Q,S), (R,T)}
✅ Connected and Acyclic
✅ Edges = 4 = 5 - 1
✅ **Valid Tree**

```
     P
      \
       Q
     /   \
    R     S
     \
      T
```

---

#### 🧠 **Example 4:**

A connected graph with 7 vertices and 6 edges
✅ Satisfies formula `n - 1` → **Tree**

---

#### 🧠 **Example 5:**

A single vertex graph `{A}`
✅ n = 1, edges = 0 = n - 1
✅ **Trivial Tree**

---

#### 🧠 **Example 6:**

A connected graph with 8 vertices and 8 edges
❌ Not a Tree (violates `n - 1` condition)

## 🟨 2. **Properties of Trees** 🌿

A **Tree** has several key mathematical and structural properties that make it unique among graphs.

---

### 📜 **Important Properties**

1. **Number of Edges:**

   * If a tree has `n` vertices → it always has `n - 1` edges.
     🔹 Formula: `|E| = |V| - 1`

2. **Unique Path Property:**

   * There is **exactly one simple path** between any two vertices.

3. **Acyclic Nature:**

   * A tree has **no cycles**.

4. **Connectivity:**

   * A tree is always **connected**.

5. **Edge Removal Property:**

   * Removing any edge disconnects the graph.

6. **Edge Addition Property:**

   * Adding one edge creates exactly **one cycle**.

7. **Rooted Trees:**

   * One node is treated as the **root**, and edges are directed outward. Common in **binary trees, AVL trees, and decision trees.**

      (B)       (C)
     /   \        \
   (D)   (E)      (F)
```

✅ 6 vertices → 5 edges (n - 1)
✅ One path between every pair of nodes
✅ Acyclic and connected

### 🧮 **6 Examples on Tree Properties**

#### ⚙️ **Example 1:**

A tree has 10 vertices → edges = 10 - 1 = **9** ✅

#### ⚙️ **Example 2:**

Removing 1 edge from a 6-vertex tree disconnects the graph ❌

#### ⚙️ **Example 3:**

Adding one edge to a 5-vertex tree creates a **cycle** ✅

#### ⚙️ **Example 4:**

Between any two vertices, only **one unique path** exists.
E.g., Path from D → F = D → B → A → C → F

#### ⚙️ **Example 5:**

For n = 7, edges = 6 → valid **Tree** ✅

#### ⚙️ **Example 6:**

Binary Tree 🌱
Each node has ≤ 2 children
E.g.,

```
     A
    / \
   B   C
  / \   \
 D   E   F
```

✅ Tree by property definition.

## 🟦 3. **Spanning Tree (Basic)** 🌿

A **Spanning Tree** is a **subgraph** of a connected graph that:

1. Includes **all vertices** of the original graph
2. Is **connected and acyclic**

If a graph has `n` vertices, its **spanning tree** will always have `n - 1` edges.

---

### 💼 **Why Spanning Trees Are Important**

* Used in **Network Design** (connect all nodes with minimal wiring)
* Used in **Routing Algorithms** (Kruskal’s, Prim’s)
* Reduces **redundant connections** and cost

---

### 🌳 **Visual Representation**

**Original Graph (G):**

```
     A
    / \
   B---C
    \ /
     D
```

**One Possible Spanning Tree:**

```
     A
    / \
   B   C
    \
     D
```

✅ Contains all vertices `{A, B, C, D}`
✅ 3 edges = 4 - 1
✅ Connected, Acyclic → **Spanning Tree**

---

### 📘 **Key Points:**

1. A graph can have **many** spanning trees.
2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** minimizes total edge weights.
3. Every connected graph has **at least one** spanning tree.
4. For a **complete graph Kₙ**, number of spanning trees = `n^(n-2)` (Cayley’s Formula).

---

### 🧮 **6 Examples on Spanning Tree**

#### 🌐 **Example 1:**

Graph G has 4 vertices → spanning tree has **3 edges (4 - 1)** ✅

#### 🌐 **Example 2:**

Complete graph K₃ → spanning trees = `3^(3-2) = 3` ✅

#### 🌐 **Example 3:**

Removing one edge from a cycle forms a **spanning tree** ✅

#### 🌐 **Example 4:**

K₅ → spanning trees = `5^(5-2) = 125` ✅

#### 🌐 **Example 5:**

Weighted graph’s **Minimum Spanning Tree** ensures all vertices connected with least cost (Prim’s or Kruskal’s Algorithm).

#### 🌐 **Example 6:**

City Network:
Cities {A, B, C, D, E} connected with 4 cables (instead of 10) → **Minimum Spanning Tree** minimizes cost 💰
