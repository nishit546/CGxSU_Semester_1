**🌲 Tree Terminologies**

### 1. **Tree** 🌳

A **tree** is a hierarchical structure composed of nodes, where each node has a value and may have zero or more child nodes.

**Visual Representation:**


               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     / \
          D   E   F   G
         / \      /     \
        H   I    J       K
       /           \
      L             M

Explanation of the expanded tree:

A is the root node.

B and C are children of A.

D, E, F, and G are children of B and C.

H and I are children of D.

L is a child of H.

J is a child of F.

K is a child of G.

M is a child of J.

### 2. **Root** 🌱

The **root** is the topmost node of the tree, which doesn't have any parent.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A       (Root)
             /   \
            B     C
```

* **A** is the root node in this tree structure.

---

### 3. **Edge** 🔗

An **edge** is a link between two nodes in a tree.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* Edges are the lines connecting parent nodes to child nodes, such as **A-B**, **A-C**, **B-D**, and so on.

---

### 4. **Parent** 👨‍👧‍👦

A **parent** node is a node that has one or more children connected to it.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **A** is the parent of **B** and **C**.
* **B** is the parent of **D** and **E**.
* **C** is the parent of **F**.

---

### 5. **Child** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

A **child** node is a node that is directly connected to another node (its parent).

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **B** and **C** are children of **A**.
* **D**, **E**, and **F** are children of **B** and **C**.

---

### 6. **Siblings** 👯

**Siblings** are nodes that share the same parent.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **B** and **C** are siblings (both share **A** as their parent).
* **D** and **E** are siblings (both share **B** as their parent).

---

### 7. **Leaf Node** 🍃

A **leaf node** is a node that has no children. These are the end nodes in the tree structure.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **D**, **E**, and **F** are leaf nodes since they have no children.

---

### 8. **Internal Node** 🏗️

An **internal node** is a node that has at least one child. These are not leaf nodes but act as connectors to the rest of the tree.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **A**, **B**, and **C** are internal nodes.
* **D**, **E**, and **F** are leaf nodes.

---

### 9. **Degree** ⚖️

The **degree** of a node is the number of children it has.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **Degree of A** = 2 (children **B** and **C**).
* **Degree of B** = 2 (children **D** and **E**).
* **Degree of C** = 1 (child **F**).
* **Degree of D**, **E**, **F** = 0 (leaf nodes).

---

### 10. **Level** 🎚️

The **level** of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node. The root node is at level 0.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A (Level 0)
             /   \
            B     C (Level 1)
           / \     \
          D   E     F (Level 2)
```

* **A** is at **Level 0**.
* **B** and **C** are at **Level 1**.
* **D**, **E**, and **F** are at **Level 2**.

---

### 11. **Path** 🚶‍♂️

A **path** is a sequence of nodes where each node is connected to the next node via an edge.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* A path from **A** to **D**: **A → B → D**
* A path from **A** to **F**: **A → C → F**

---

### 12. **Subtree** 🏡

A **subtree** is a portion of the tree starting from any node, including all its descendants.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* The subtree rooted at **B** is:

```
        B
       / \
      D   E
```

* The subtree rooted at **C** is:

```
        C
         \
          F
```

---

### 13. **Height** 📏

The **height** of a tree is the longest path from the root to any leaf node, measured in terms of edges.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* The height of the tree is **2**, since the longest path (A → B → D) has 2 edges.

---

### 14. **Depth** 🌍

The **depth** of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A (Depth 0)
             /   \
            B     C (Depth 1)
           / \     \
          D   E     F (Depth 2)

## 🌳 **1. Binary Tree**

### 🧠 **Definition:**

A **Binary Tree** is a data structure made up of **nodes**, where each node has **at most two children** — a **left child** and a **right child**.
It is called “binary” because every node branches into two possible directions.
The **topmost node** is called the **root**, and nodes with no children are called **leaf nodes**.
Binary trees can be **empty**, **skewed**, or **balanced**, depending on the distribution of their nodes.

They are used in various applications like **hierarchical data storage**, **parsing expressions**, **search algorithms**, and **decision-making systems**.

---

### 🔹 **Visual Representation:**

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \   \
    D   E   F
```

**Explanation of the structure:**

* `A` → Root node
* `B` and `C` → Internal nodes
* `D`, `E`, `F` → Leaf nodes

---

### 💡 **Example 1:**

**Input Binary Tree:**

```
        10
       /  \
      5    20
     / \
    3   7
```

**Explanation:**

* `10` → Root
* `5` → Left child of 10
* `20` → Right child of 10
* `3` and `7` → Children of `5`
* Leaf nodes = 3, 7, and 20

✅ **Answer:** This is a valid Binary Tree since every node has **at most two children**.

---

### 💡 **Example 2:**

**Input Binary Tree:**

```
        X
       / 
      Y
       \
        Z
```

**Explanation:**

* `X` → Root
* `Y` → Left child of `X`
* `Z` → Right child of `Y`

✅ **Answer:** Still a valid Binary Tree (though not full or complete) because no node has more than 2 children.

---

---

## 🌲 **2. Full Binary Tree**

### 🧠 **Definition:**

A **Full Binary Tree** (also called a **Proper** or **Strict Binary Tree**) is one in which **every internal node has exactly two children** and **leaf nodes have none**.
In this type of tree:

* No node has only one child.
* The structure is perfectly branched.

**Formula:**
If a full binary tree has `n` leaf nodes, then total nodes = `2n - 1`.

Used in **expression trees**, **Huffman coding**, and **compiler syntax trees**.

---

### 🔹 **Visual Representation:**

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \ / \
    D  E F  G
```

**Explanation:**

* Internal nodes → `A`, `B`, `C`
* Leaf nodes → `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`
* Every internal node has **two** children ✅

---

### 💡 **Example 1:**

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```

**Explanation:**

* Node `3` has only one child (❌ none on right side).

❌ **Answer:** Not a Full Binary Tree — node `3` violates the rule (has only one child).

---

### 💡 **Example 2:**

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

**Explanation:**

* Each non-leaf node (`1`, `2`, `3`) has **exactly two** children.
  ✅ **Answer:** This **is a Full Binary Tree.**

---

---

## 🌴 **3. Complete Binary Tree**

### 🧠 **Definition:**

A **Complete Binary Tree** is a tree in which **all levels are fully filled**, except possibly the **last level**, which is **filled from left to right**.
It ensures no gaps between nodes in the last level.
Used in **Binary Heaps** (Min-Heap, Max-Heap) because it allows **efficient storage in arrays**.

---

### 🔹 **Visual Representation:**

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \  /
    D  E F
```

**Explanation:**

* Levels 1 and 2 fully filled.
* Last level has `D`, `E`, `F` (filled left to right).
  ✅ Therefore, this is a Complete Binary Tree.

---

### 💡 **Example 1:**

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \  
    4   5
```

**Explanation:**

  ❌ **Answer:** Not a Complete Binary Tree **
---

### 💡 **Example 2:**

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
       \
        4
```

**Explanation:**

  ❌ **Answer:** Not a Complete Binary Tree (violates ).

---

## 🌾 **4. Almost Complete (At-most Complete) Binary Tree**

### 🧠 **Definition:**

An **Almost Complete Binary Tree** (also called **At-most Complete**) is a **nearly complete** tree.
It satisfies **most** properties of a complete tree, except that **some nodes may be missing in the last or second last levels**, but **all nodes remain as left-aligned as possible**.

It is widely used where the tree may **lose a few nodes** due to deletion but still maintains efficient structure — e.g., **heap after removal**.

---

### 🔹 **Visual Representation:**

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \
    D   E
```

**Explanation:**

* Level 1 and 2 fully filled.
* Last level has nodes (`D`, `E`) — aligned left.
  ✅ Hence, an **Almost Complete Binary Tree**.

---

### 💡 **Example 1:**

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / 
    4   
```

**Explanation:**

* Node `4` exists but the position after `4` (right side of node 2) is missing.
  ✅ **Answer:** Almost Complete — structure is left-aligned.

---

### 💡 **Example 2:**

```
        10
       /  \
      20   30
     / \    
    40  50
```

**Explanation:**

* All nodes are filled **as left as possible**.
  ✅ **Answer:** This is an Almost Complete Binary Tree (not fully complete because last level isn’t full, but still left-aligned).
