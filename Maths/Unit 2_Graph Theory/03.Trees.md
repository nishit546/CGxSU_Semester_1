
### 1. **Tree**

A **tree** is a hierarchical structure composed of nodes, where each node has a value and may have zero or more child nodes.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
         /           /
        G           H
```

* **A** is the root.
* **B** and **C** are children of **A**.
* **D**, **E**, and **F** are children of **B** and **C** respectively.
* **G** and **H** are leaf nodes.

---

### 2. **Root**

The **root** is the topmost node of the tree, which doesn't have any parent.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A       (Root)
             /   \
            B     C
```

* **A** is the root node in this tree structure.

---

### 3. **Edge**

An **edge** is a link between two nodes in a tree.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* Edges are the lines connecting parent nodes to child nodes, such as **A-B**, **A-C**, **B-D**, and so on.

---

### 4. **Parent**

A **parent** node is a node that has one or more children connected to it.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **A** is the parent of **B** and **C**.
* **B** is the parent of **D** and **E**.
* **C** is the parent of **F**.

---

### 5. **Child**

A **child** node is a node that is directly connected to another node (its parent).

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **B** and **C** are children of **A**.
* **D**, **E**, and **F** are children of **B** and **C**.

---

### 6. **Siblings**

**Siblings** are nodes that share the same parent.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **B** and **C** are siblings (both share **A** as their parent).
* **D** and **E** are siblings (both share **B** as their parent).

---

### 7. **Leaf Node**

A **leaf node** is a node that has no children. These are the end nodes in the tree structure.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **D**, **E**, and **F** are leaf nodes since they have no children.

---

### 8. **Internal Node**

An **internal node** is a node that has at least one child. These are not leaf nodes but act as connectors to the rest of the tree.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **A**, **B**, and **C** are internal nodes.
* **D**, **E**, and **F** are leaf nodes.

---

### 9. **Degree**

The **degree** of a node is the number of children it has.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* **Degree of A** = 2 (children **B** and **C**).
* **Degree of B** = 2 (children **D** and **E**).
* **Degree of C** = 1 (child **F**).
* **Degree of D**, **E**, **F** = 0 (leaf nodes).

---

### 10. **Level**

The **level** of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node. The root node is at level 0.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A (Level 0)
             /   \
            B     C (Level 1)
           / \     \
          D   E     F (Level 2)
```

* **A** is at **Level 0**.
* **B** and **C** are at **Level 1**.
* **D**, **E**, and **F** are at **Level 2**.

---

### 11. **Path**

A **path** is a sequence of nodes where each node is connected to the next node via an edge.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* A path from **A** to **D**: **A → B → D**
* A path from **A** to **F**: **A → C → F**

---

### 12. **Subtree**

A **subtree** is a portion of the tree starting from any node, including all its descendants.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* The subtree rooted at **B** is:

```
        B
       / \
      D   E
```

* The subtree rooted at **C** is:

```
        C
         \
          F
```

---

### 13. **Height**

The **height** of a tree is the longest path from the root to any leaf node, measured in terms of edges.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A
             /   \
            B     C
           / \     \
          D   E     F
```

* The height of the tree is **2**, since the longest path (A → B → D) has 2 edges.

---

### 14. **Depth**

The **depth** of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

**Visual Representation:**

```
               A (Depth 0)
             /   \
            B     C (Depth 1)
           / \     \
          D   E     F (Depth 2)
```

* **Depth of A** = 0.
* **Depth of B** = 1.
* **Depth of C** = 1.
* **Depth of D** = 2.
* **Depth of E** = 2.
* **Depth of F** = 2.
