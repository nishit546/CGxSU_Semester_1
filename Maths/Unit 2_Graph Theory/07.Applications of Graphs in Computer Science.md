## 🌐 **1️⃣ Network Routing**

In **computer networking**, a **graph** represents how computers, routers, and servers are **interconnected**.
Each **device (node)** connects to others via **communication links (edges)**.
Edges can have **weights** that represent:

* ⏱️ Transmission time
* 📶 Bandwidth cost
* ⚡ Latency or delay

Algorithms like **Dijkstra’s**, **Bellman-Ford**, and **Floyd-Warshall** help in finding the **optimal path** for data packets — ensuring **fast, reliable, and cost-efficient** data transfer.

### 🧠 **Key Points**

1. 💻 Devices → Nodes
2. 🔗 Connections → Edges
3. ⚙️ Weights → Time / Cost / Bandwidth
4. 🎯 Goal → Find the best route for data transmission
5. 🧮 Common Algorithms → Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Bellman-Ford
6. 🌍 Used in → Internet routing, WANs, and data centers
