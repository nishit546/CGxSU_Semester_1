# 📘 Propositional logic

Propositional logic is the **foundation of mathematical logic, computer science, and reasoning**. It allows us to represent statements and reason about their truth values using logical connectives. These notes cover **statements, connectives, truth tables, tautologies, and contradictions** in depth.

***

## 🔹 1. Statements – Definition 📝

A **statement** (or proposition) is a **declarative sentence that is either true or false**, but not both.

* **Truth Value:** Each statement has a truth value: **True (T)** or **False (F)**.
* **Non-statement examples:** Questions, commands, or sentences like “Close the door” are **not statements** because they cannot be assigned truth values.

💡 **Detailed Explanation:**

* Statements are the **building blocks of logic**. Every logical argument is constructed using statements.
* They can represent **mathematical facts, conditions in algorithms, or assertions in programming**.
* In computing, statements are often used as **boolean expressions**, which evaluate to True or False, enabling conditional execution.

**Visual Representation:**

```
"5 + 3 = 8" → True ✅
"2 is greater than 7" → False ❌
```

## 🔹 2. Logical Connectives – Definition ⚙️

Logical connectives are **operators used to combine or modify statements**. They are essential in building **compound statements** that represent complex reasoning.

1. **Negation (¬)** – reverses the truth value
    * Syntax: `¬p` (not p)
    * Example: If `p = True`, then `¬p = False`
    * **Explanation:** Negation allows us to express **opposite conditions**, like checking if a user is **not logged in**.
2. **Conjunction (∧)** – logical AND
    * Syntax: `p ∧ q`
    * True only if both `p` and `q` are true
    * **Explanation:** Conjunction is used when **multiple conditions must simultaneously hold**, e.g., `if(isAdult ∧ hasTicket)`.
3. **Disjunction (∨)** – logical OR
    * Syntax: `p ∨ q`
    * True if **at least one** of `p` or `q` is true
    * **Explanation:** Disjunction models situations where **any one of multiple conditions is sufficient**, e.g., `if(isWeekend ∨ isHoliday)`.
4. **Implication (→)** – if-then
    * Syntax: `p → q`
    * False only if `p = True` and `q = False`
    * **Explanation:** Implication expresses **cause-and-effect or conditional dependencies**. In programming: `if condition then action`.
5. **Biconditional (↔)** – if and only if
    * Syntax: `p ↔ q`
    * True if `p` and `q` have the same truth value
    * **Explanation:** Biconditional represents **equivalence**; in computing, it’s useful in **validating equality conditions**.

**Visual Representation (Truth Table Layout):**


| p | q | ¬p | p ∧ q | p ∨ q | p → q | p ↔ q |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| T | T | F | T | T | T | T |
| T | F | F | F | T | F | F |
| F | T | T | F | T | T | F |
| F | F | T | F | F | T | T |

💡 **Explanation:**

* Connectives allow **complex logical expressions** to be modeled.
* They form the basis for **boolean algebra, digital logic circuits, and programming conditions**.

## 🔹 3. Truth Tables – Definition 📊

A **truth table** lists **all possible truth values of statements** and shows the result of a compound proposition.

**Example:** For `p ∧ q`


| p | q | p ∧ q |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | F |

💡 **Detailed Explanation:**

* Each row represents a **unique combination of truth values**.
* Truth tables provide a **systematic way to check validity, equivalence, and logical consistency**.
* In computing, truth tables are used to **design digital circuits and verify algorithms**.

***

## 🔹 4. Tautology – Definition ✅

A **tautology** is a compound proposition that is **always true**, no matter what the truth values of its components are.

* Symbolically: Always evaluates to `T` in its truth table.
* Example: `p ∨ ¬p` is always true.

💡 **Detailed Explanation:**

* Tautologies are essential in **logical proofs** and **program verification**, as they indicate statements that are **universally valid**.
* In computing, they can represent **default conditions or invariants** that must always hold.

***

## 🔹 5. Contradiction – Definition ❌

A **contradiction** is a compound proposition that is **always false**, regardless of the truth values of its components.

* Example: `p ∧ ¬p` is always false.

💡 **Detailed Explanation:**

* Contradictions are used to **identify errors or inconsistencies** in reasoning.
* In computing, contradictions may indicate **invalid logic conditions or impossible scenarios** that need handling.

## 🔹 6. Examples 📑

### Normal Examples:

1. **Simple Statements:**
    * `p`: “It is raining”
    * `q`: “I will take an umbrella”
    * Compound: `p → q` → If it rains, I will take an umbrella.
2. **Truth Table Example:**
For `p ∨ q`


| p | q | p ∨ q |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | F |
| T | T | T |


### Real-Life Examples 🌍

1. **Computing Example:**
    * Condition in a program: `if (isLoggedIn ∧ isAdmin)`
    * Only executes if **user is logged in AND is admin**. ✅
2. **Daily-Life Example:**
    * `I will go for a walk OR watch a movie`
    * True if either or both conditions happen. 🎬🚶‍♂️

## 🔹 7. Visual Representation 🎨

**Venn Diagram Representation of Connectives:**

```
p ∧ q → Intersection of p and q
p ∨ q → Union of p and q
¬p   → Everything outside p
```

**Truth Table Representation for p → q**


| p | q | p → q |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |

## 🔹 8. Formula Sheet 📑

1. **Negation:** ¬p
2. **Conjunction:** p ∧ q
3. **Disjunction:** p ∨ q
4. **Implication:** p → q = ¬p ∨ q
5. **Biconditional:** p ↔ q = (p → q) ∧ (q → p)
6. **Tautology Example:** p ∨ ¬p
7. **Contradiction Example:** p ∧ ¬p
8. **De Morgan’s Laws:**
    * ¬(p ∧ q) = ¬p ∨ ¬q
    * ¬(p ∨ q) = ¬p ∧ ¬q
9. **Equivalence:** p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q
