# 📘 Relations and Functions 

## 🔹 1. Relation – Definition

A **Relation** is a way of showing a **connection or association** between elements of two sets.

* Mathematically, a relation from set `A` to set `B` is a **subset** of the Cartesian product `A × B`.
* The Cartesian product `A × B` contains **all possible ordered pairs** `(a, b)` where `a ∈ A` and `b ∈ B`.
* A relation selects some of these pairs to express meaningful connections.

👉 Example:
If `A = {1, 2, 3}` and `B = {x, y}`,
then `A × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y), (3, x), (3, y)}`.
Now, relation `R = {(1, x), (2, y)}` means **1 is related to x, and 2 is related to y**.

📌 **Key Properties of Relations:**

* A relation can be **one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many**.
* Relations describe **general associations** but do not require uniqueness of mapping.

**Visual Representation:**

```
A = {1, 2, 3}  
B = {x, y}

R = {(1, x), (2, y)}

   A → B
   1 → x
   2 → y
   3 → (no relation)
```

✨ In computing, relations describe **links in databases** (like mapping a *student* to *courses* they take).

## 🔹 2. Function – Definition

A **Function** is a **special type of relation** that follows stricter rules:

* Every element of the **domain** must map to **exactly one element** in the codomain.
* This means **no input has two outputs**, though two inputs can have the same output.

👉 Think of a function as a **machine** 🏭:

* Input = element from domain.
* Machine processes it.
* Output = element in codomain.

**Syntax:**

```text
f : A → B
```

This means function `f` maps set `A` (domain) to set `B` (codomain).

📌 **Key Properties of Functions:**

* **One-to-One (Injective):** Different inputs map to different outputs.
* **Onto (Surjective):** Every element in the codomain has at least one pre-image.
* **Bijective:** Both one-to-one and onto (perfect matching between sets).

**Visual Representation:**

```
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {a, b, c}

f = {(1, a), (2, b), (3, c)}

   1 → a
   2 → b
   3 → c
```

👉 In computing, functions represent **algorithms** or **code blocks** that transform input to output.

## 🔹 3. Domain, Codomain, and Range

### 🌐 Domain

* The **Domain** is the set of all possible **inputs** that a function or relation accepts.
* If a value is not in the domain, it cannot be used as an input.
* Example: For `f(x) = 1/x`, the domain is **all real numbers except 0**, since division by zero is undefined.


### 🌐 Codomain

* The **Codomain** is the **target set** where the outputs are defined.
* It represents the “destination” of the function, even if not all elements are reached.
* Example: For `f(x) = x²`, codomain may be chosen as all real numbers `ℝ`, but the actual outputs are only non-negative.


### 🌐 Range

* The **Range** is the set of **actual outputs** the function produces (a subset of the codomain).
* Example: For `f(x) = x²`, Domain = `{1, 2, 3}`, Codomain = `ℝ`, but Range = `{1, 4, 9}`.

📌 **Important Notes:**

* **Domain** = Inputs allowed
* **Codomain** = Outputs possible (by definition)
* **Range** = Outputs actually produced

**Visual Representation:**

```
Domain   →   Codomain
  {1,2,3} → {1,4,9,16,...}
           ↳ Range = {1,4,9}
```

✨ This distinction is important in computer science: in **type systems**, the domain is the input type, the codomain is the declared return type, and the range is the actual set of values returned during execution.

## 🔹 4. Syntax and Notation Recap

* **Relation:** `R ⊆ A × B`
* **Function:** `f : A → B`
* **Domain:** Set of all possible inputs.
* **Codomain:** Set of all possible outputs (by definition).
* **Range:** Set of actual outputs (subset of codomain).

## 📑 Examples

### ✅ Normal Examples

1. **Relation Example**
    * `A = {1, 2}`, `B = {x, y}`
    * `R = {(1, x), (2, y)}`
    * This relation simply connects numbers with letters (general association).
2. **Function Example**
    * `f : A → B` where `A = {1, 2, 3}` and `B = {10, 20, 30}`
    * `f = {(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30)}`
    * Each input has one unique output ✅ → valid function.

### 🌍 Real-Life Examples

1. **Computing Example (Database Relation)**
    * Set `A` = Student IDs = {101, 102, 103}
    * Set `B` = Course IDs = {C1, C2}
    * Relation `R = {(101, C1), (102, C2), (103, C1)}`
    * 👉 This shows which students are enrolled in which courses.
    * Note: A student can enroll in multiple courses (relation, not necessarily a function).
2. **Programming Example (Function in Code)**
    * Consider a function in **Python**:

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x
```

    * Domain = All integers
    * Codomain = All integers
    * Range = Only perfect squares (0, 1, 4, 9, …)
    * 👉 Demonstrates how mathematical functions are **implemented in computing** 💻.

# 📑 Formula Sheet

* **Relation:** `R ⊆ A × B`
* **Cartesian Product:** `A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}`
* **Function Notation:** `f : A → B`
* **Domain:** `{ x | x is an input to f }`
* **Codomain:** `{ y | y is a possible output target }`
* **Range:** `{ f(x) | x ∈ Domain } ⊆ Codomain`
* **Injective (One-to-One):** `f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ x1 = x2`
* **Surjective (Onto):** `∀ y ∈ Codomain, ∃ x ∈ Domain : f(x) = y`
* **Bijective:** Both injective and surjective.
