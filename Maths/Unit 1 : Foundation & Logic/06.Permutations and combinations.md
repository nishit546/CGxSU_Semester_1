# 📘 Permutations and Combinations 

Permutations and combinations are **fundamental concepts in combinatorics**, used to **count arrangements and selections** efficiently. These concepts are widely applied in **mathematics, probability, statistics, computer science, and real-life problem solving**.

This note also introduces the **Binomial Theorem (basic level)** for expanding powers of binomials.

## 🔹 1. Introduction 🔢

* **Counting problems** often involve arranging or selecting objects under certain conditions.
* **Permutations** deal with **arrangements** where **order matters**.
* **Combinations** deal with **selections** where **order does not matter**.
* Understanding these concepts provides a **foundation for probability, combinatorial proofs, and algebraic expansions**.

💡 **Detailed Explanation:**

* Permutations and combinations help **avoid the tedious process of listing all possibilities**.
* They are the **basis for advanced combinatorial problems**, including probability calculations, algorithmic analysis, and statistics.
* **Factorials** are a key component, representing the product of all positive integers up to n.
* Mastery of these concepts enhances **logical reasoning and problem-solving skills**.

## 🔹 2. Permutations (Order Matters) 🔄

**Definition:**
A **permutation** is an **arrangement of objects in a specific order**.

**Formulas:**

1. **Permutation of n distinct objects:**

$$
P(n) = n!
$$

2. **Permutation of r objects from n distinct objects:**

$$
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

**Detailed Explanation:**

* Factorial (n!) = n × (n-1) × ... × 2 × 1.
* When selecting r objects from n, the permutation formula counts **all possible ordered arrangements**.
* Permutations are used in situations where **position or sequence matters**, such as races, seating arrangements, and codes.
* Can be applied to **repeated objects** with slight modifications: divide by factorial of repeated elements.

**Visual Representation – Tree Diagram:**

* Tree diagram for arranging 3 objects (A, B, C):

```
A→B→C
A→C→B
B→A→C
B→C→A
C→A→B
C→B→A
```

* Shows all **6 possible ordered arrangements**.

**Normal Example:**

* Arrange 3 books on a shelf → P(3) = 3! = 6 ✅

**Real-Life Example 🌍:**

1. Arranging **3 runners in a race** (1st, 2nd, 3rd positions) → 3! = 6 ways 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️
2. Forming a **password of 3 letters from 5 distinct letters** → P(5,3) = 60 🔑

## 🔹 3. Combinations (Order Doesn’t Matter) ✅

**Definition:**
A **combination** is a **selection of objects where order does not matter**.

**Formula:**

$$
C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$

**Detailed Explanation:**

* Divide by r! because **order of selection is irrelevant**.
* Commonly called “n choose r.”
* Combinations are used when **only the group composition matters**, such as committees, lottery selections, and handshakes.
* Can be applied to **identical objects** and **multisets** using advanced combinatorial methods.

**Visual Representation – Set Diagram:**

* Selecting 2 fruits from {Apple, Banana, Mango}:

```
Apple + Banana
Apple + Mango
Banana + Mango
```

* Only **unique groups** are counted, not order.

**Normal Example:**

* Select 2 students from 4 → C(4,2) = 6 ✅

**Real-Life Example 🌍:**

1. Choosing **3 team members from 10 employees** → C(10,3) = 120 👥
2. Forming a **committee of 2 students from 5 volunteers** → C(5,2) = 10 🏫

## 🔹 4. Relationship Between Permutations and Combinations 🔗

$$
P(n,r) = C(n,r) \times r!
$$

* Explanation: **Choose r objects (combination) and then arrange them (permutation)**.
* Helps **switch between counting arrangements and selections** easily.
* Useful for problems where **both selection and arrangement are required**.

## 🔹 5. Binomial Theorem (Basic) 🌟

**Definition:**
The **Binomial Theorem** gives the expansion of $(a+b)^n$ for a **non-negative integer n**.

**Formula:**

$$
(a+b)^n = \sum_{r=0}^{n} \binom{n}{r} a^{n-r}b^r
$$

**Detailed Explanation:**

* Each term corresponds to **choosing r b’s** from n total factors.
* $\binom{n}{r}$ = number of ways to choose r b’s → directly links to **combinations**.
* The theorem is crucial for **algebraic expansions, probability, and combinatorial proofs**.

**Normal Example:**

* Expand $(x+y)^3$:

$$
(x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3
$$

**Real-Life Example 🌍:**

1. Probability of **2 heads in 3 coin tosses** → $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways 🪙
2. Distributing **3 identical prizes among 5 students** using combination logic → C(5,3) = 10 🏆

## 🔹 6. Key Points / Tips 📌

1. **Permutation:** Order matters. Use P(n,r) formulas.
2. **Combination:** Order doesn’t matter. Use C(n,r) formulas.
3. **Relationship:** P(n,r) = C(n,r) × r!
4. **Binomial Theorem:** Connects algebra and combinatorics via combinations.
5. **Visual Aids:** Use tree diagrams for permutations and set diagrams for combinations.
6. **Factorials:** Master factorials for solving problems efficiently.
7. **Advanced Tip:** Check for **repetition of objects** or **constraints**, as formulas may need modification.
