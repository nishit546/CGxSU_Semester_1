---

### 📘 **Definition**

Conditional Probability is the **likelihood of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred**. It refines our prediction when we already know partial information.

It is denoted as:
[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A ∩ B)}{P(B)}, \text{ where } P(B) > 0
]

Here,

* ( P(A|B) ): Probability of event **A** occurring given **B** occurred.
* ( P(A ∩ B) ): Probability that **both A and B** occur.
* ( P(B) ): Probability that **B** occurs.

Conditional Probability is widely used in **Bayesian statistics**, **machine learning**, **medical diagnosis**, and **risk analysis**. It updates our belief about an event when we have new evidence.

### 💡 **Concept Insight**

Conditional probability is like **updating our perspective** when we gain new information.
👉 Example: The probability that a student passed Math increases **given that** they already passed Science.

### 🧩 **Examples (with Explanation)**

---

#### 🃏 **Example 1:** Drawing a King given that the card is a Face card

1. Total cards = 52
2. Face cards = {J, Q, K} = 12
3. Kings = 4
4. ( P(A ∩ B) = 4/52, P(B) = 12/52 )
   [
   P(King|Face) = \frac{4/52}{12/52} = \frac{1}{3}
   ]
   ✅ **Answer:** Probability = 1/3

---

#### 🎲 **Example 2:** Rolling a die – Even number given it’s greater than 3

1. Sample space = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
2. A = Even = {2,4,6}
3. B = Number > 3 = {4,5,6}
4. A ∩ B = {4,6}
   [
   P(A|B) = \frac{2/6}{3/6} = \frac{2}{3}
   ]
   ✅ **Answer:** Probability = 2/3

---

#### 🃏 **Example 3:** Red card given it’s a Heart

1. A = Red card, B = Heart
2. Red = 26/52, Heart = 13/52
3. ( P(A ∩ B) = 13/52 )
   [
   P(A|B) = \frac{13/52}{13/52} = 1
   ]
   ✅ **Answer:** 100% chance since every Heart is Red.

---

#### 🪙 **Example 4:** Two coins – At least one Head given first is Head

1. S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
2. A = At least one Head = {HH, HT, TH}
3. B = First is Head = {HH, HT}
   [
   P(A|B) = \frac{2/4}{2/4} = 1
   ]
   ✅ **Answer:** 1 → Guaranteed.

---

#### 👩‍🎓 **Example 5:** Student passing both subjects

1. P(Math) = 0.7
2. P(Math ∩ Science) = 0.4
   [
   P(Science|Math) = \frac{0.4}{0.7} = 0.57
   ]
   ✅ **Answer:** 57% chance of passing Science given they passed Math.

---

#### 🌧️ **Example 6:** Match postponed given it rains

1. P(Rain) = 0.4
2. P(Postponed ∩ Rain) = 0.32
   [
   P(Postponed|Rain) = \frac{0.32}{0.4} = 0.8
   ]
   ✅ **Answer:** 80% chance of postponement if it rains.

### 🧠 **Conclusion**

Conditional probability helps in **updating predictions** after learning new facts. It’s key to **Bayes’ theorem**, **data analytics**, and **decision-making under uncertainty**.

## 🔗 **2️⃣ Independence of Events**

---

### 📘 **Definition**

Two events A and B are **independent** if the occurrence of one does **not affect** the occurrence of the other.

Mathematically,
[
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
]

or equivalently,
[
P(A|B) = P(A) \quad \text{and} \quad P(B|A) = P(B)
]

This means that even if one event happens, it gives **no extra information** about the other.

**Example:** Tossing a coin 🎲 and rolling a die 🎯 are independent; the result of one doesn’t affect the other.

### 🎨 **Visual Representation**

```
Independent Events (No Influence)
---------------------------------------
 ●  A                 ●  B
 (No overlap dependency)
 P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
```

---

### 💡 **Concept Insight**

If two events are independent, the **probability of both** occurring equals the **product of individual probabilities**.
If this is not true, the events are **dependent**.

---

### 🧩 **Examples (with Explanation)**

---

#### 🪙 **Example 1:** Tossing two coins

1. A = “First coin is Head”
2. B = “Second coin is Tail”
   [
   P(A) = 1/2, , P(B) = 1/2, , P(A ∩ B) = 1/4
   ]
   [
   P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
   ]
   ✅ **Independent events**

---

#### 🎲 **Example 2:** Rolling two dice

1. A = “First die shows even”
2. B = “Second die shows > 4”
   [
   P(A) = 3/6, , P(B) = 2/6
   ]
   [
   P(A ∩ B) = (3/6) × (2/6) = 1/6
   ]
   ✅ **Independent**

---

#### 🃏 **Example 3:** Drawing cards **with replacement**

1. A = “First is Ace” = 4/52
2. B = “Second is King” = 4/52
   [
   P(A ∩ B) = \frac{4}{52} × \frac{4}{52}
   ]
   ✅ Independent (because of replacement).

---

#### 🃏 **Example 4:** Drawing cards **without replacement**

1. A = “First is Ace”, B = “Second is King”
   [
   P(A) = 4/52, , P(B|A) = 4/51
   ]
   [
   P(A) × P(B) ≠ P(A ∩ B)
   ]
   ❌ Dependent (since deck changes after draw).

---

#### 🌧️ **Example 5:** Rain ☔ and Traffic Jam 🚗

Rain increases traffic chances.
Thus, ( P(Jam|Rain) > P(Jam) ).
❌ **Dependent**

---

#### 🎯 **Example 6:** Coin toss & die roll

A = “Coin shows Head”, B = “Die shows 5”
[
P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/6, P(A ∩ B) = 1/12
]
✅ **Independent events**

---

### 🧠 **Conclusion**

Independence simplifies complex probability problems. When events are independent, we can directly multiply their probabilities. This concept is widely applied in **probability distributions**, **random experiments**, and **statistical modeling**.
