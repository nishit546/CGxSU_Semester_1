---

**Conditional Probability:**
Conditional probability is the probability of an event happening **after** we already know that another event has happened. It tells us how likely something is when extra information is given.

**Visual Representation:**

```
Sample Space
 ┌──────────────────────────┐
 |          B               |
 |     ┌──────────────┐     |
 |     |    A ∩ B     |     |
 |     └──────────────┘     |
 └──────────────────────────┘
Only this overlapped region matters for P(A|B)
```

**Formulas:**
P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
(when P(B) > 0)

P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)
(when P(A) > 0)

# Solved examples (step-by-step)

**Q1.** A die is rolled. If the outcome is an even number, what is the probability that it is a prime number?
**Solution (step-by-step):**

1. Sample space for a die: ({1,2,3,4,5,6}).
2. Given event (B): outcome is even (={2,4,6}). So (P(B)=3/6).
3. Event (A): outcome is prime (={2,3,5}).
4. Intersection (A\cap B={2}) so (P(A\cap B)=1/6).
5. Use formula (P(A|B)=\dfrac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}=\dfrac{1/6}{3/6}=\dfrac{1}{3}.)

**Answer:** (\boxed{1/3})

**Q2.** A die is thrown twice and the sum observed is 6. What is the conditional probability that the number 4 has appeared at least once?
**Solution (step-by-step):**

1. List ordered pairs (first,second) with sum 6: ((1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1)). So there are 5 equally likely outcomes given the sum 6.
2. Outcomes with at least one 4: ((2,4),(4,2)) — 2 outcomes.
3. Conditional probability = number favorable / total = (2/5).

**Answer:** (\boxed{2/5})

---

**Q3.** A coin is tossed three times. Find (P(E|F)) for the following:

**(i)** (E): Head on third toss. (F): Heads on first two tosses.
**Solution:** Given (F), first two tosses are (H,H). Third toss can be (H) or (T). So sample space under (F) = ({HHH, HHT}). (E) occurs only in ({HHH}). Thus (P(E|F)=1/2).
**Answer:** (\boxed{1/2})

---

**(ii)** (E): At least two heads. (F): At most two heads.
**Solution (step-by-step):**

1. Total outcomes for 3 tosses = 8.
2. “At least two heads” = outcomes with exactly 2 heads or 3 heads. Exactly 2 heads = 3 outcomes. Exactly 3 heads = 1 outcome → at least two heads = (3+1=4) outcomes.
3. “At most two heads” = all outcomes except the one with 3 heads → (8-1=7) outcomes.
4. Intersection (E\cap F) = outcomes with exactly 2 heads (because 3 heads is not in (F)) = 3 outcomes.
5. (P(E|F)=\dfrac{#(E\cap F)}{#(F)}=\dfrac{3}{7}.)

**Answer:** (\boxed{3/7})

---

**(iii)** (E): At most two tails. (F): At least one tail.
**Solution (step-by-step):**

1. Total outcomes = 8.
2. “At most two tails” = all outcomes except (TTT) → (8-1=7) outcomes.
3. “At least one tail” = all outcomes except (HHH) → (8-1=7) outcomes.
4. Intersection excludes both (HHH) and (TTT) → (8-2=6) outcomes.
5. (P(E|F)=\dfrac{6/8}{7/8}=\dfrac{6}{7}.)

**Answer:** (\boxed{6/7})

**Q4.** A card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. If the selected card is a face card (Jack, Queen, King), what is the probability that it is a King?
**Solution (step-by-step):**

1. Face cards = J, Q, K of each suit → (4+4+4=12) cards.
2. Kings among face cards = 4.
3. (P(\text{King} \mid \text{Face}) = \dfrac{4}{12}=\dfrac{1}{3}.)

**Answer:** (\boxed{1/3})

---

**Q5.** Two dice are rolled and the sum obtained is 7. What is the conditional probability that one of the dice shows 3?
**Solution (step-by-step):**

1. Ordered outcomes with sum 7: ((1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)) — 6 equally likely outcomes.
2. Outcomes where one die is 3: ((3,4),(4,3)) — 2 outcomes.
3. Conditional probability (=2/6=1/3.)

**Answer:** (\boxed{1/3})

## 🔗 **2️⃣ Independence of Events**

---

### 📘 **Definition**

Two events A and B are **independent** if the occurrence of one does **not affect** the occurrence of the other.

Mathematically,
[
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
]

or equivalently,
[
P(A|B) = P(A) \quad \text{and} \quad P(B|A) = P(B)
]

This means that even if one event happens, it gives **no extra information** about the other.

**Example:** Tossing a coin 🎲 and rolling a die 🎯 are independent; the result of one doesn’t affect the other.

### 🎨 **Visual Representation**

```
Independent Events (No Influence)
---------------------------------------
 ●  A                 ●  B
 (No overlap dependency)
 P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
```

---

### 💡 **Concept Insight**

If two events are independent, the **probability of both** occurring equals the **product of individual probabilities**.
If this is not true, the events are **dependent**.

---

### 🧩 **Examples (with Explanation)**

---

#### 🪙 **Example 1:** Tossing two coins

1. A = “First coin is Head”
2. B = “Second coin is Tail”
   [
   P(A) = 1/2, , P(B) = 1/2, , P(A ∩ B) = 1/4
   ]
   [
   P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
   ]
   ✅ **Independent events**

---

#### 🎲 **Example 2:** Rolling two dice

1. A = “First die shows even”
2. B = “Second die shows > 4”
   [
   P(A) = 3/6, , P(B) = 2/6
   ]
   [
   P(A ∩ B) = (3/6) × (2/6) = 1/6
   ]
   ✅ **Independent**

---

#### 🃏 **Example 3:** Drawing cards **with replacement**

1. A = “First is Ace” = 4/52
2. B = “Second is King” = 4/52
   [
   P(A ∩ B) = \frac{4}{52} × \frac{4}{52}
   ]
   ✅ Independent (because of replacement).

---

#### 🃏 **Example 4:** Drawing cards **without replacement**

1. A = “First is Ace”, B = “Second is King”
   [
   P(A) = 4/52, , P(B|A) = 4/51
   ]
   [
   P(A) × P(B) ≠ P(A ∩ B)
   ]
   ❌ Dependent (since deck changes after draw).

---

#### 🌧️ **Example 5:** Rain ☔ and Traffic Jam 🚗

Rain increases traffic chances.
Thus, ( P(Jam|Rain) > P(Jam) ).
❌ **Dependent**

---

#### 🎯 **Example 6:** Coin toss & die roll

A = “Coin shows Head”, B = “Die shows 5”
[
P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/6, P(A ∩ B) = 1/12
]
✅ **Independent events**

---

### 🧠 **Conclusion**

Independence simplifies complex probability problems. When events are independent, we can directly multiply their probabilities. This concept is widely applied in **probability distributions**, **random experiments**, and **statistical modeling**.
