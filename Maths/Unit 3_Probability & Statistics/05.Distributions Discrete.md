A **discrete probability distribution** provides the probabilities of **countable outcomes** of a random variable — such as the number of successes, failures, or arrivals in a process. The key property is that
$$[
\sum P(X = x_i) = 1
]$$
Discrete distributions are essential for understanding real-world events that involve **counting** — like the number of students passing an exam, emails received per hour, or defective items in a batch.

There are three main discrete distributions:
1️⃣ **Bernoulli Distribution**
2️⃣ **Binomial Distribution**
3️⃣ **Poisson Distribution**

## 🪙 **1️⃣ Bernoulli Distribution**

### 📘 **Definition:**

The **Bernoulli Distribution** is the simplest form of a probability distribution. It represents a **single trial** that has **two possible outcomes** — typically called **success (1)** and **failure (0)**.

* Probability of success = **p**
* Probability of failure = **q = 1 - p**

It’s used in binary situations — such as pass/fail, yes/no, or win/lose experiments.

📘 **Formula:**
$$[
P(X = x) = p^x(1 - p)^{1 - x}, \quad x \in {0,1}
]$$

📊 **Mean (E[X]) = p**
📊 **Variance (Var[X]) = p(1 - p)**

### 💡 **Examples with Detailed Explanation**

1️⃣ **🪙 Coin Toss**

* p(Head) = 0.5, p(Tail) = 0.5
  ✅ **P(X=1)=0.5** → Equal chance for head or tail.

2️⃣ **🏭 Product Test (Pass/Fail)**

* p(Pass) = 0.9
  ✅ 9 out of 10 products are expected to pass quality control.

3️⃣ **💡 Bulb Working or Not**

* p(Working) = 0.98
  ✅ Only 2% failure rate → Highly reliable bulbs.

4️⃣ **🌐 Server Request Success**

* p(Success) = 0.95
  ✅ 95% chance that a request completes successfully.

5️⃣ **🛒 Customer Purchase**

* p(Buy) = 0.3
  ✅ Out of 100 customers, about 30 will make a purchase.

6️⃣ **🎓 Exam Result (Pass/Fail)**

* p(Pass) = 0.8
  ✅ 80% probability of a student passing an exam.

## 🎯 **2️⃣ Binomial Distribution**

### 📘 **Definition:**

The **Binomial Distribution** extends the Bernoulli distribution to **multiple independent trials**. It gives the probability of getting exactly **k successes** in **n independent experiments**, each with the same success probability **p**.

📘 **Formula:**
$$[
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1 - p)^{n - k}
]$$

where

* ( n ) = number of trials
* ( k ) = number of successes
* ( p ) = probability of success

📊 **Mean (E[X]) = np**
📊 **Variance (Var[X]) = np(1 - p)**

### 💡 **Examples with Detailed Explanation**

1️⃣ **🪙 Coin Toss (n=3, p=0.5)**
$$[
P(X=2) = \binom{3}{2}(0.5)^3 = 0.375
]$$
✅ Probability of getting exactly 2 heads = **37.5%**.

2️⃣ **🏭 Product Testing (n=5, p=0.8)**
$$[
P(X=5) = (0.8)^5 = 0.32768
]$$
✅ 32.7% chance that all 5 products pass.

3️⃣ **🛍️ Customer Purchases (n=10, p=0.3)**
$$[
E[X] = np = 10 × 0.3 = 3
]$$
✅ On average, 3 customers will buy.

4️⃣ **⚙️ Defective Items (n=20, p=0.1)**
$$[
Var(X) = np(1-p) = 1.8

## 📞 **3️⃣ Poisson Distribution**

### 📘 **Definition:**

The **Poisson Distribution** models the **number of times an event occurs** in a fixed time or space interval, given a known **average rate (λ)**.
It is suitable for **rare or random events** happening independently — such as phone calls, defects, or arrivals.

📘 **Formula:**
$$[
P(X = k) = \frac{e^{-λ} λ^k}{k!}, \quad k = 0,1,2,...
]$$

📊 **Mean (E[X]) = λ**
📊 **Variance (Var[X]) = λ**
