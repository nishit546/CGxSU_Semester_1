---

## 📖 **1. Definition of Probability**

**Definition:**
Probability is the mathematical study of uncertainty — it measures how likely an event is to occur. It provides a numerical value between **0 and 1**, where **0** means “impossible” and **1** means “certain.” Probability is widely used in statistics, AI, data analytics, finance, and even daily decision-making.

**Formula:**
[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
]

**Key Concept:**
👉 The sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes in a sample space is always equal to **1**.

### 🧩 **Visual Representation**

```
🪙 Coin Toss Experiment
-------------------------
Sample Space (S) = {H, T}

Probabilities:
P(H) = 1/2
P(T) = 1/2
```

---

### 💡 **Examples with Explanations**

**🧮 Example 1:** Tossing a coin once

* Sample Space: S = {H, T}
* Favourable for Head = 1 outcome
* ✅ P(H) = 1/2 = 0.5

**🎲 Example 2:** Rolling a die

* S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
* Favourable for even = {2, 4, 6} (3 outcomes)
* ✅ P(Even) = 3/6 = 1/2

**🃏 Example 3:** Drawing a red card

* Total = 52 cards, Red = 26 cards
* ✅ P(Red) = 26/52 = 1/2

**👑 Example 4:** Drawing a King

* Favourable = 4 Kings
* ✅ P(King) = 4/52 = 1/13

**📅 Example 5:** Random leap year has 53 Sundays

* Possible start-day combinations = 7
* 2 favourable → ✅ P(53 Sundays) = 2/7

**🔠 Example 6:** Picking a vowel from “MATHEMATICS”

* Total = 11 letters, Vowels = 4 (A, E, A, I)
* ✅ P(Vowel) = 4/11

## 🎲 **2. Sample Space**

**Definition:**
The **Sample Space (S)** is the complete set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. Each individual outcome is called a **sample point**. It is the foundation upon which all probabilities are calculated.

**Importance:**
🧭 The sample space defines the universe of outcomes — it acts as the **denominator** in probability formulas.

### 📊 **Visual Representation**

```
🎲 Rolling a Die
-------------------------
Sample Space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Each number → one equally likely outcome
```

---

### 💡 **Examples with Explanations**

**🪙 Example 1:** Tossing a coin once
→ S = {H, T}

**🪙 Example 2:** Tossing two coins
→ S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
→ Total outcomes = 4

**🎲 Example 3:** Rolling a die
→ S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

**🃏 Example 4:** Drawing a card
→ S = {All 52 cards in a deck}

**📅 Example 5:** Choosing a day of the week
→ S = {Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun}

**🔢 Example 6:** Selecting a number from 1–5
→ S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

**🧠 Explanation:**
Sample space ensures clarity — without identifying all outcomes first, it’s impossible to calculate accurate probabilities.

## 🎯 **3. Events**

**Definition:**
An **Event (E)** is a subset of a sample space that represents one or more outcomes we are interested in. Events describe what we are trying to measure — like “getting a head,” “drawing a red card,” or “rolling an even number.”

**Types of Events:**

* **Simple Event:** One outcome (e.g., rolling a 3)
* **Compound Event:** Multiple outcomes (e.g., rolling an even number)
* **Certain Event:** Always true (P = 1)
* **Impossible Event:** Never happens (P = 0)

### 💡 **Examples with Explanations**

**🎲 Example 1:** Rolling a die → Event A = “Getting a 3”

* E = {3}, ✅ P(A) = 1/6

**🎲 Example 2:** Event B = “Getting number > 4”

* E = {5, 6}, ✅ P(B) = 2/6 = 1/3

**🎲 Example 3:** Event C = “Getting a prime number”

* E = {2, 3, 5}, ✅ P(C) = 3/6 = 1/2

**🎲 Example 4:** Event D = “Getting an odd number”

* E = {1, 3, 5}, ✅ P(D) = 3/6 = 1/2

**🪙 Example 5:** Tossing two coins → Event E = “At least one Head”

* S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}, Favourable = {HH, HT, TH}
* ✅ P(E) = 3/4

**🃏 Example 6:** Drawing a spade

* E = {13 spade cards}, ✅ P(E) = 13/52 = 1/4

## 📘 **4. Axioms of Probability**

**Definition:**
The **Axioms of Probability** (by Andrey Kolmogorov) provide a formal mathematical foundation to ensure probabilities behave logically and consistently.

---

### ⚖️ **The Three Axioms**

**Axiom 1: Non-Negativity**
[
P(E) \geq 0
]
✅ The probability of any event cannot be negative.

**Axiom 2: Normalization (Certainty)**
[
P(S) = 1
]
✅ The probability of the entire sample space (a sure event) is 1.

**Axiom 3: Additivity (for Disjoint Events)**
If E₁ and E₂ are mutually exclusive (cannot occur together):
[
P(E₁ ∪ E₂) = P(E₁) + P(E₂)
]

|     ● E1          ● E2               |
|   (No overlap → Disjoint Events)     |
 ---------------------------------------
If E1 ∩ E2 = ∅, then P(E1 ∪ E2) = P(E1) + P(E2)
```

---

### 💡 **Examples with Explanations**

**🎲 Example 1:** Event A = “Even number” = {2, 4, 6}

* ✅ P(A) = 3/6 = 1/2 ≥ 0

**🎲 Example 2:** Event B = “Odd number” = {1, 3, 5}

* ✅ P(B) = 3/6 = 1/2
* A and B disjoint → P(A ∪ B) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

**🪙 Example 3:** Tossing a coin → S = {H, T}

* ✅ P(S) = 1 (Normalization)

**🪙 Example 4:** Mutually exclusive events

* E₁ = “Head”, E₂ = “Tail”
* ✅ P(E₁ ∪ E₂) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

**🃏 Example 5:** Red and Black cards

* E₁ = Red (26), E₂ = Black (26)
* ✅ P(E₁ ∪ E₂) = 26/52 + 26/52 = 1

**🚫 Example 6:** Impossible event

* E = ∅, ✅ P(E) = 0
