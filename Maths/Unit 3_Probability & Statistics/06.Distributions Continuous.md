---

## 🎯 **Definition**

The **Normal Distribution** (also called **Gaussian Distribution**) is a continuous probability distribution that describes data which cluster around a mean (average) value. It has a **bell-shaped curve** 📈 that is **symmetric** about its mean (μ), meaning values near the mean occur more frequently than values far from it.

📐 The mathematical formula for the normal distribution is:

$$[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
]$$

where:

* **μ (mu)** → Mean of the distribution
* **σ (sigma)** → Standard deviation
* **σ²** → Variance

📊 The **total area under the curve = 1**, representing total probability.
Most real-world phenomena such as **height, weight, IQ, and exam scores** follow this pattern of normality.

## ⚙️ **Key Characteristics**

1. 🔹 The curve is **symmetrical** about the mean.
2. 🔹 **Mean = Median = Mode** in a normal distribution.
3. 🔹 The **total area under the curve is 1**.
4. 🔹 The curve is **bell-shaped** and **asymptotic** to the x-axis.
5. 🔹 The **spread** of the curve depends on the **standard deviation (σ)**.
6. 🔹 Follows the **Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)** for data spread.

# 💡 **6 Detailed Examples for Better Understanding**

---

### ✅ **Example 1: Height of Students**

📏 Suppose heights of students in a class follow N(μ=170 cm, σ=10 cm).

* Using the Empirical Rule:

  * 68% of students → between 160 cm and 180 cm (μ ± σ)
  * 95% of students → between 150 cm and 190 cm (μ ± 2σ)
  * 99.7% of students → between 140 cm and 200 cm (μ ± 3σ)
    ✨ **Answer:** Most students’ heights are near 170 cm, very few are extremely tall or short.

---

### ✅ **Example 2: Exam Marks Distribution**

🧾 Exam scores follow N(μ=70, σ=10).

* 68% of students score between 60 and 80.
* 95% of students score between 50 and 90.
* 99.7% of students score between 40 and 100.
  📘 **Answer:** If you score 90, you are among the top 2.5% students — excellent performance!

---

### ✅ **Example 3: IQ Scores**

🧠 IQ follows N(μ=100, σ=15).

* 68% of people have IQ 85–115.
* 95% have IQ 70–130.
* 99.7% have IQ 55–145.
  🎯 **Answer:** Only 2.5% people have IQ above 130 — considered “very superior.”

### ✅ **Example 4: Machine Measurement Error**

⚙️ Suppose measurement errors of a sensor follow N(μ=0, σ=2).

* 68% of errors → between -2 and +2 units.
* 95% of errors → between -4 and +4 units.
  🔍 **Answer:** Most readings are accurate; large deviations are very rare.

### ✅ **Example 5: Stock Market Daily Returns**

💹 Stock returns follow N(μ=0%, σ=2%).

* 68% of days → returns between -2% and +2%.
* 95% of days → between -4% and +4%.
  💼 **Answer:** Extreme market crashes (like -10%) happen less than 1% of the time.

### ✅ **Example 6: Blood Pressure Levels**

🩺 Blood pressure (systolic) follows N(μ=120 mmHg, σ=15).

* 68% people → 105–135 mmHg
* 95% people → 90–150 mmHg
* 99.7% people → 75–165 mmHg
  ❤️ **Answer:** Readings above 150 mmHg are statistically rare and considered high.
