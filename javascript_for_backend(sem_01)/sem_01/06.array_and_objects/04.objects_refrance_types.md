# **Objects as Reference Types in JavaScript**

This article teaches one of the most misunderstood fundamentals in JavaScript:
**Objects are reference types, not value types.**

# Objects as Reference Types in JavaScript

In JavaScript, **primitive values** (like numbers, strings, booleans) behave differently from **objects**.

Understanding how objects are stored in memory is very important.
This single concept explains why:

* assigning one object to another does not create a copy
* two variables may show the “same changes”
* arrays behave like objects
* methods work inside objects
* updating through one reference updates the original object

This article focuses on **fundamentals**, without ES6 features.

# 1. Primitive Types vs Reference Types

JavaScript stores **primitive values** directly.

Examples of primitives:

* number
* string
* boolean
* null
* undefined

```javascript
var a = 10;
var b = a;   // a copy of the value 10 is created

b = 20;

console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // 20
```

Changing `b` does NOT change `a`.

Because they are stored separately.

---

# 2. Objects Are Stored by Reference

Objects (and arrays) are **not stored directly** in the variable.

Instead:

* The variable stores a *reference* (a pointer) to the actual object in memory.

Example:

```javascript
var student = {
    name: "Jenil",
    age: 18
};
```

Here:

* The object `{name: "Jenil", age: 18}` lives in memory
* The variable `student` stores only a reference (a “link”) to it

---

# 3. Copying Objects Does NOT Create a New Object

Very important:

```javascript
var student1 = {
    name: "Mahir",
    age: 18
};

var student2 = student1;   // Only the reference is copied
```

Now:

* `student1` and `student2` both point to the **same object**
* No new object is created

---

# 4. Changes Through Any Reference Affect the Same Object

```javascript
var student1 = { name: "Arjun", age: 18 };
var student2 = student1;

student2.name = "Arjun Patel";

console.log(student1.name); // Arjun Patel
console.log(student2.name); // Arjun Patel
```

Both variables show the same result because:

* They are two references to ONE object.

---

# 5. Real Life Example (CodingGita)

Assume the CodingGita system stores a student's profile:

```javascript
var profile = {
    name: "Krishna",
    course: "CSE",
    marks: 90
};

var displayData = profile;   // Only reference is copied

displayData.marks = 95;
```

Now both access the updated marks:

```javascript
console.log(profile.marks);     // 95
console.log(displayData.marks); // 95
```

Because there is only one object in memory.

---

# 6. Arrays Behave the Same Way

Arrays are also objects.

```javascript
var a = [10, 20, 30];
var b = a;

b.push(40);

console.log(a); // [10, 20, 30, 40]
console.log(b); // [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

Adding to `b` affects `a`.

---

# 7. How to Truly Copy an Object

```javascript
var s1 = { name: "Yashvi", marks: 88 };
var s2 = {};

s2.name = s1.name;
s2.marks = s1.marks;

s2.marks = 95;

console.log(s1.marks); // 88  (unchanged)
console.log(s2.marks); // 95  (independent)
```

Now they are independent.

# 8. Summary Table

| Type      | Stored As | Example      | Behavior                                     |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Primitive | Value     | `var a = 10` | Copying creates a new independent value      |
| Object    | Reference | `var o = {}` | Copying copies the reference, not the object |

---

# 9. Common Mistakes

1. Believing `var a = b;` creates a new object
2. Thinking arrays are separate when assigned
3. Updating one reference and expecting the other to remain unchanged
4. Comparing two objects directly (they compare references)
5. Forgetting this rule when passing objects to functions

---

# 10. Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1

Create an object:

```javascript
var stu1 = { name: "Jenil", marks: 90 };
var stu2 = stu1;
```

Modify `stu2.marks`.
Observe `stu1.marks`.

---

### Exercise 2

Manually copy the object so the two objects behave independently.

---

### Exercise 3

Try this:

```javascript
var arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
var arr2 = arr1;

arr2.push(4);
```

Check `arr1`.

---

### Exercise 4

Make an object `book` containing two fields.
Copy it by reference.
Change one property through the second reference.
Print the result.

---

### Exercise 5

Create a `car` object with:

* brand
* model
  Copy the object manually and show both behave independently.

---

# 11. Multiple Choice Questions

### Q1. Copying an object using `=` creates:

1. A new object
2. A separate memory
3. A reference copy
4. A deep clone

**Answer: 3**

---

### Q2. What will this print?

```javascript
var a = { x: 10 };
var b = a;

b.x = 20;

console.log(a.x);
```

1. 10
2. 20
3. undefined
4. Error

**Answer: 2**

---

### Q3. Arrays in JavaScript are:

1. Primitives
2. Reference types
3. Stored as values
4. Copied by value

**Answer: 2**

---

# 12. Mini Assignment

Create five student objects containing:

* name
* roll
* marks

Then:

1. Assign each object to a new variable (reference copy)
2. Modify marks using the second variable
3. Print the results to show that both have the same updated value
4. Then create a **manual deep copy** and show that modifying the copy does not affect the original

This assignment demonstrates the difference between **reference copy** and **manual copy**.
