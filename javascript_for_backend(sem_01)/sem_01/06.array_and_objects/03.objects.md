# Objects in JavaScript

Objects are one of the most important concepts in JavaScript.
Nearly everything in JavaScript is built around objects.

---

# 1. What Is an Object?

An **object** is a collection of **key–value pairs**.
Each key is called a **property**, and each value can be:

* Number
* String
* Boolean
* Array
* Another object
* Function (method)

Objects allow you to represent real-world entities clearly.

### Example:

```javascript
var student = {
    name: "Jenil",
    age: 18,
    course: "CSE"
};
```

---

# 2. Why Do We Need Objects?

Objects help in representing:

* Students
* Books
* Employees
* Products
* Cars
* API data

They bundle related information together.

Example:
Instead of 3 separate variables:

```javascript
var name = "Mahir";
var age = 18;
var marks = 88;
```

Use:

```javascript
var student = { name: "Mahir", age: 18, marks: 88 };
```

Cleaner and organised.

---

# 3. Creating Objects

### Method 1: Object Literal (most common)

```javascript
var student = {
    name: "Arjun",
    age: 18,
    marks: 92
};
```

### Method 2: Using new Object()

```javascript
var student = new Object();
student.name = "Krishna";
student.age = 19;
student.marks = 85;
```

---

# 4. Accessing Object Properties

Two ways:

### 1. Dot notation

```javascript
console.log(student.name);
```

### 2. Bracket notation

```javascript
console.log(student["age"]);
```

Bracket notation is useful when keys come from variables or keys contain spaces.

---

# 5. Adding New Properties

You can add properties anytime.

```javascript
var student = { name: "Yashvi", age: 18 };

student.course = "CSE";
student["batch"] = "2025";

console.log(student);
```

---

# 6. Updating Property Values

```javascript
student.age = 19;
student["name"] = "Yashvi Patel";
```

---

# 7. Deleting Properties

```javascript
delete student.age;
```

---

# 8. Objects Can Store Anything

Objects can store any data type, including arrays and other objects.

### Example:

```javascript
var course = {
    title: "JavaScript",
    duration: 30,
    topics: ["Basics", "Functions", "Scope", "Arrays"],
    instructor: {
        name: "Kartik",
        experience: 12
    }
};
```

---

# 9. Methods: Functions Inside Objects

A function inside an object is called a **method**.

### Example:

```javascript
var student = {
    name: "Priyesha",
    marks: 90,
    greet: function() {
        return "Hello, " + this.name;
    }
};

console.log(student.greet());
```

Explanation:

* `this` refers to the current object (`student`).

---


# 10. Looping Through an Object 

### Example:

```javascript
var student = {
    name: "Krishna",
    age: 18,
    course: "CSE"
};

console.log("name:", student.name);
console.log("age:", student.age);
console.log("course:", student.course);
```

---

# 11. Nested Objects

Objects can contain other objects.

```javascript
var student = {
    name: "Arjun",
    address: {
        city: "Ahmedabad",
        pincode: 380015
    }
};

console.log(student.address.city);
```

---

# 12. Array of Objects (Very Important)

Used everywhere: databases, APIs, servers.

### Example:

```javascript
var students = [
    { name: "Jenil", marks: 85 },
    { name: "Mahir", marks: 90 },
    { name: "Yashvi", marks: 92 }
];

for (var i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
    console.log(students[i].name, students[i].marks);
}
```

This prepares students for:

* Fetch API
* CRUD operations
* Backend logic
* JSON

# 13. Objects vs Arrays (Beginner Clarification)

| Feature   | Object                | Array         |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Structure | key–value pairs       | ordered list  |
| Access    | by key                | by index      |
| Best for  | representing entities | storing lists |

---

# 14. Example

### Store student details:

```javascript
var student = {
    name: "Krishna",
    scores: [85, 92, 88],
    getAverage: function() {
        var total = this.scores[0] + this.scores[1] + this.scores[2];
        return total / 3;
    }
};

console.log(student.getAverage());
```

---

# 15. Common Mistakes Students Make

1. Using dot notation with variables:

```javascript
var key = "name";
console.log(student.key); // wrong
console.log(student[key]); // correct
```

2. Forgetting quotes around string keys:

```javascript
var obj = { name: "Krishna" }; // correct
```

3. Assuming order of properties is fixed (it is not guaranteed).

4. Confusing objects with arrays.

5. Forgetting that `this` refers to the object.

# 16. Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1

Create an object `book` with properties:

* title
* author
* price
  Print all values.

### Exercise 2

Add a method `discountedPrice()` that returns `price - 50`.

### Exercise 3

Create an array of 5 student objects:

* name
* marks
  Print names and marks using a loop.

### Exercise 4

Add an `address` object inside each student.

### Exercise 5

Create a `course` object with:

* name
* duration
* topics (array)
* instructor (object)

Print the instructor's name.

# 17. Multiple Choice Questions

### Q1. How do you access the property "name"?

```javascript
var s = { name: "Jenil" };
```

1. s(name)
2. s.name
3. name.s
4. s->name

**Answer:** 2

---

### Q2. What does delete do?

1. Remove last element
2. Remove property
3. Remove first element
4. Clear whole object

**Answer:** 2

---

### Q3. What will this print?

```javascript
var obj = { a: 10, b: 20 };
console.log(obj["b"]);
```

1. a
2. b
3. 10
4. 20

**Answer:** 4

---

# 18. Mini Assignment

Create an array named **codingGitaData** containing 5 student objects.
Each object must include:

* name
* roll
* 3 marks stored in an array
* a method `getAverage()` that returns the student's average

Then:

1. Loop through each student
2. Print:

```
Name:
Roll:
Marks:
Average:
```
