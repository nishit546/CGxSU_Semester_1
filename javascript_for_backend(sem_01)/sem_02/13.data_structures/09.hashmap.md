# **9: HashMap (Key–Value Data Structure)**

## What Is a HashMap

A HashMap is a **key–value data structure**.

* Each **key** maps to a **value**
* Access to values is **fast**
* Data is retrieved by key, not by position

HashMaps are used when **lookup by identity** matters more than order.

You can think of a HashMap as **labeled slots**:

* You ask for a value using a **label (key)**
* The key points directly to a storage location
* The value is retrieved immediately
*

## HashMap in JavaScript

JavaScript provides HashMap-like behavior through:

* **Object**
* **Map**

Both store data as key–value pairs.

---

## Object as a HashMap

```js
const user = {
  id: 101,
  name: "Neel",
  role: "student"
};
```

Access is done using keys:

```js
user.name; // "Neel"
```

Objects are commonly used when:

* Keys are strings
* Structure is known in advance

---

## Map as a HashMap

```js
const dataMap = new Map();

dataMap.set("id", 101);
dataMap.set("name", "Neel");
```

Access:

```js
dataMap.get("name"); // "Neel"
```

`Map` is preferred when:

* Keys are not strings
* Frequent additions and removals are needed
* Order of insertion matters

---

## Object vs Map (Practical Comparison)

| Feature         | Object         | Map               |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Key type        | Mostly strings | Any type          |
| Insertion order | Not reliable   | Preserved         |
| Size property   | No             | Yes               |
| Intended use    | General data   | Key–value storage |

Both represent the **HashMap concept**.

---

## Why HashMaps Are Important

HashMaps provide:

* Fast lookup
* Clear association between data
* Efficient state tracking

They are chosen when:

* Searching through arrays would be inefficient
* Each item must be accessed directly by key

---

## HashMaps in JavaScript Applications

### 1. State Storage

```js
const state = {
  loading: true,
  error: null,
  data: null
};
```

This allows quick checks and updates without scanning data.

---

### 2. Caching

```js
const cache = new Map();

function getData(key) {
  if (cache.has(key)) {
    return cache.get(key);
  }
}
```

HashMaps are ideal for caching because:

* Lookup is fast
* Data is uniquely identified by key

---

## HashMaps and Async JavaScript (Where It Fits)

Async systems often need to **remember ongoing work**.

Examples:

* Tracking pending API calls
* Matching requests to responses
* Storing async results temporarily

Conceptually:

```js
pendingRequests.set(requestId, callback);
```

When a response arrives:

* The correct callback is retrieved using the key
* Execution continues safely

This would be inefficient with arrays.

---

## HashMaps vs Arrays (When to Choose What)

| Use Case              | Choose  |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Ordered list          | Array   |
| Direct lookup         | HashMap |
| Sequential processing | Array   |
| State tracking        | HashMap |

Understanding this choice improves both performance and clarity.

---

## Key Characteristics

* Data accessed by key, not index
* Very fast lookup
* Widely used in real applications
* Essential for state and identity-based storage

---

## Summary

* HashMaps store key–value pairs
* JavaScript uses Objects and Maps for this purpose
* Ideal for lookup, caching, and state tracking
* Commonly used in async coordination
* Chosen when identity matters more than order
