# **8: Graph Data Structure**

## What Is a Graph

A graph is a **non-linear data structure** made up of:

* **Nodes (Vertices)** → entities
* **Edges** → connections between entities

Unlike trees:

* There is **no fixed root**
* Nodes can connect in **many-to-many** relationships
* Cycles are allowed

Graphs are used when data is **interconnected**, not hierarchical.

## Visualizing a Graph

Each circle represents a node, and each line represents a connection.

## Basic Graph Terminology

* **Vertex (Node)** – a data point
* **Edge** – a connection between two nodes
* **Directed Graph** – edges have direction
* **Undirected Graph** – edges have no direction
* **Weighted Graph** – edges have values (cost, distance, etc.)

## Simple Graph Example

```
A —— B
|    |
C —— D
```

Here:

* Each node is connected to multiple nodes
* There is no top or bottom
* Multiple paths exist between nodes

---

## How Graphs Are Represented

Graphs are usually represented in two ways.

### 1. Adjacency List (Most Common)

```js
const graph = {
  A: ["B", "C"],
  B: ["A", "D"],
  C: ["A", "D"],
  D: ["B", "C"]
};
```

Each node stores a list of connected nodes.

---

### 2. Adjacency Matrix (Conceptual)

A table where rows and columns represent nodes.

Used when:

* Graph is dense
* Fast connection checks are needed

---

## Graphs in JavaScript (Real Usage)

### 1. Routing and Navigation

* Maps and GPS systems
* Finding paths between locations
* Navigation inside applications

Each location is a node, each road is an edge.

---

### 2. Dependency Relationships

Graphs are used to represent:

* Module dependencies
* Task dependencies
* Build pipelines

Example:

```js
A depends on B
B depends on C
```

This forms a **directed graph**.

---

## Graphs and Async JavaScript (Where It Fits)

Async systems often deal with **dependent tasks**.

Example:

* Task A must complete before Task B
* Task C can run independently

This dependency structure is naturally represented as a **graph**.

```js
TaskA → TaskB
TaskA → TaskC
```

Graphs help:

* Visualize async workflows
* Manage dependencies
* Avoid circular dependencies

---

## Cycles in Graphs (Important Concept)

A cycle occurs when a path leads back to the same node.

```
A → B → C → A
```

Why this matters:

* Infinite loops in dependencies
* Deadlocks in workflows
* Circular imports in JavaScript modules

Understanding graphs helps identify and avoid such issues.

## Graph vs Tree (Quick Comparison)

| Feature        | Tree         | Graph         |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Structure      | Hierarchical | Network-based |
| Root required  | Yes          | No            |
| Cycles allowed | No           | Yes           |
| Relationships  | One-to-many  | Many-to-many  |

## When to Use a Graph

Use a graph when:

* Data is interconnected
* Multiple paths exist
* Relationships matter more than order

Graphs are not about sequence — they are about **connections**.

---

## Summary

* Graphs model networks and relationships
* Nodes are connected by edges
* Used for routing, dependencies, and workflows
* Helpful for understanding async dependency chains
* More flexible than trees
