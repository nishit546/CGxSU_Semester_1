# **1: Arrays in JavaScript**

## Why We Start with Arrays

Before we talk about **async**, **event loop**, or **promises**, we must start with something you already know well.

That thing is **arrays**.

Arrays are not just a beginner topic in JavaScript.
They are the **base structure** on top of which JavaScript builds:

* Function execution flow
* Async task scheduling
* Promise handling
* Callback storage

If you truly understand arrays, async JavaScript becomes *logical*, not confusing.

## What Is an Array (The Practical Meaning)

In JavaScript, an array is:

* An **ordered collection**
* Stored in memory
* Accessed using an index (0, 1, 2, …)

```js
const numbers = [10, 20, 30];
```

### Visualizing an Array

Each value is stored at a specific position, and JavaScript always respects this order.

---

## Arrays Can Store Functions (This Changes Everything)

Arrays in JavaScript can store **anything**, including **functions**.

```js
const tasks = [];

tasks.push(() => {
  console.log("Task 1");
});

tasks.push(() => {
  console.log("Task 2");
});
```

Now `tasks` is no longer just data — it is **work waiting to run**.

### Why This Matters

This is the **exact idea** JavaScript uses for:

* Callbacks
* Event handlers
* Promise `.then()` functions

Once functions go into arrays, **async JavaScript begins**.

---

## Arrays and Order of Execution

Arrays preserve **order**.

```js
const steps = ["load", "process", "finish"];
```

```js
steps[0]; // load
steps[1]; // process
```

### Execution Order Visualization

This idea of **ordered execution** is the backbone of:

* Function execution
* Callback execution
* Promise chaining

## Array Operations That Matter for Async Thinking

You already know these methods — now we reinterpret them.

---

### push() — Add work at the end

```js
tasks.push("new task");
```

Used when:

* A new async operation is registered
* A callback is added for later execution

---

### pop() — Remove work from the end

```js
tasks.pop();
```

This operation will soon evolve into the **stack** concept.

---

### shift() — Remove from the front

```js
tasks.shift();
```

This introduces the idea of a **queue**, which is critical for async behavior.

## Arrays in Memory (What Happens Behind the Scenes)

Arrays live in **heap memory**.

Conceptually:

* The array reference may appear in execution
* The actual data lives in memory
* Values stay alive even when execution pauses

This is why async code can resume later without losing data.

---

## Arrays Are Everywhere Inside JavaScript

Even when you don’t see them, JavaScript uses arrays internally for:

* Storing callback functions
* Managing promise handlers
* Maintaining execution order

Example:

```js
promise.then(fn1);
promise.then(fn2);
```

Internally (conceptually):

```js
handlers = [fn1, fn2];
```

This is why promise chaining works in order.

## The Most Important Mental Shift

Before this article, you might have thought:

> “Arrays store data.”

From now on, think this instead:

> **“Arrays store future work.”**

This single idea prepares you for:

* Stack
* Queue
* Event loop
* Promises
* async / await

---

## What This Article Unlocks Next

Because you now understand:

* Ordered execution
* `push`, `pop`, `shift`
* Function storage inside arrays

You are ready for the next concept:

> **Restrict how an array is used, and you get a Stack.**

---

## Quick Recap

* Arrays are the foundation of JavaScript internals
* They store values **and functions**
* Order matters
* Async behavior starts with arrays
