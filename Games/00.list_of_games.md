# üéÆ JavaScript Roadmap

This roadmap will guide you through creating interactive JavaScript games ‚Äî starting from simple DOM event projects to complex logic-based games with data persistence.  
Each project strengthens your understanding of **events**, **timers**, **DOM manipulation**, **localStorage**, and **sessionStorage**.

---

## üü¢ BEGINNER LEVEL ‚Äî Focus on Events & Basic DOM Manipulation

### 1. Click Counter Game
- Learn click event listeners  
- Update DOM elements dynamically (`innerText`, `querySelector`)  
- Use `setInterval` for timing logic  
- Store and display high score using `localStorage`

### 2. Color Guessing Game
- Handle multiple button clicks using event listeners  
- Manipulate styles dynamically (change colors, text)  
- Work with arrays and random values  
- Save best streak in `localStorage`

### 3. Whack-a-Mole
- Use random intervals for element visibility  
- Detect clicks on specific DOM elements  
- Add and remove CSS classes dynamically  
- Score counter logic with DOM updates  
- Store max score in `localStorage`

### 4. Typing Speed Test
- Listen for input events on text fields  
- Manage countdown timer using `setInterval`  
- Update DOM live for WPM and accuracy  
- Save best typing score using `sessionStorage`

### 5. Memory Flip Card Game
- Flip cards with click events  
- DOM updates for matching/unmatching states  
- Add timers for auto-flip reset  
- Implement restart/reset functionality  
- Save recent score in `localStorage`

## üü° INTERMEDIATE LEVEL ‚Äî Focus on DOM Logic + Data Storage

### 6. To-Do Game / Productivity Challenge
- Add and remove list items dynamically  
- Handle events using event delegation  
- Store tasks, streaks, and completion status in `localStorage`  
- Use `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` for structured storage  

### 7. Quiz Game
- Use arrays of question objects  
- Create reusable DOM functions for navigating between questions  
- Track score and timer for each round  
- Save quiz progress and high score using `localStorage`

### 8. Tic-Tac-Toe
- Handle cell click events and turns  
- Implement win/draw condition logic  
- Add reset or replay feature  
- Store recent match history or player names in `sessionStorage`

### 9. Snake Game
- Use `keydown` events for movement  
- Render grid or canvas dynamically  
- Manage game loop using `setInterval`  
- Detect collisions and update score  
- Save high score in `localStorage`

### 10. Rock Paper Scissors (with Scoreboard)
- Handle user input via button clicks  
- Use random logic for computer‚Äôs move  
- DOM updates for round results and totals  
- Store total wins/losses/ties in `localStorage`  
- Add a reset feature for a new session

## üîµ ADVANCED LEVEL ‚Äî Focus on Game State Management + Storage Integration

### 11. Sudoku / Puzzle Solver
- Generate a 9√ó9 grid dynamically using DOM  
- Track user input for each cell  
- Implement validation logic for rows and columns  
- Auto-save progress in `localStorage` (resume later)  
- Add a ‚ÄúCheck Solution‚Äù button with DOM feedback  

### 12. 2048 Game Clone
- Use `keydown` for move detection  
- Create and update tile positions dynamically  
- Merge tiles and animate using CSS transitions  
- Manage full game state in JS objects  
- Persist score and state using `localStorage`

### 13. Space Shooter / Car Racing Game
- Use `keydown` and `keyup` for continuous movement  
- Create and move elements dynamically using `requestAnimationFrame`  
- Detect collisions between objects  
- Update score and levels in real time  
- Save highest level reached using `localStorage`

### 14. Wordle Clone
- Capture keyboard input programmatically  
- Validate guessed words and provide feedback colors  
- Update UI dynamically for each attempt  
- Track daily attempts using `sessionStorage`  
- Store last played word using `localStorage`

### 15. Mini Arcade Leaderboard (Multi-Game Platform)
- Combine 2‚Äì3 smaller games (e.g., Click Counter, Quiz, Memory Game)  
- Create a central leaderboard using `localStorage`  
- Modularize JavaScript files per game  
- Display cumulative scores across sessions  
- Manage user profiles (player name, avatar, total points)

## **Final Assignment ‚Äî Chaturanga Game (in JavaScript)**

- After completing all 15 JavaScript games, your final project is to create a **Chaturanga** game ‚Äî an ancient Indian strategy game that inspired modern chess. 

- You need to build it using **vanilla JavaScript**, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and game state logic. The game should feature an 8√ó8 board, piece movement and capture rules, turn management, and basic win detection. Make the UI clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly.
