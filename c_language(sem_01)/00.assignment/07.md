### **1. Structure + Array of Structure + Function**

Define a structure `Book` with:

* id
* title
* price

Create an array of **5 books with predefined values**.
Write a program to:

* find and print the book with the **lowest price**
* print all books whose price is **above the average price**

---

### **2. Structure + Sorting**

Define a structure `Player` with:

* name
* runs
* matches

Create an array of **5 predefined players**.
Write a program to:

* calculate runs-per-match ratio for each player
* sort all players in **descending order of ratio**
* print the sorted list

---

### **3. Union Storage Behavior**

Create a union containing:

* int x
* float y
* char z

Assign values **one after another** (no input).
After each assignment, print all members to clearly show how the **last assignment overwrites the others** due to shared memory.

---

### **4. Union + Manual Assignment Test**

Create a union `Data` with:

* int roll
* float marks
* char grade

Assign a roll number first, print all members.
Then assign marks, print all members.
Then assign a grade, print all members.
Observe which values get corrupted after each assignment.

---

### **5. Enum + Switch**

Create an enum `Weekday` with Monday to Sunday.
Take a **hardcoded value** (e.g., `Weekday w = WEDNESDAY;`).
Use switch to print:

* "Weekday" for Mon–Fri
* "Weekend" for Sat–Sun

---

### **6. Enum + Non-Sequential Values**

Create an enum `TrafficLight`:

* RED = 1
* YELLOW = 3
* GREEN = 5

Write a program that prints the numeric value and the meaning:

* RED → Stop
* YELLOW → Wait
* GREEN → Go

Using only the enum values (no user input).

---

### **7. Switch + Calculator with Fixed Values**

Write a program that uses:

* two **hardcoded numbers**
* a **hardcoded operation code**

Use switch to perform:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division (handle division by zero using default case only)

---

### **8. Largest of Three Numbers with Ternary**

Take three **predefined integers**, and using only nested ternary operators (no if/switch), find and print the **largest number**.
