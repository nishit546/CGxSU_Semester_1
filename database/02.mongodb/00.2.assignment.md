## **Assignment 3: MongoDB vs Relational Databases**

Complete the table below **without referring back to the article**.

| Aspect                         | Relational Database | MongoDB |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------- |
| Data storage format            |                     |         |
| Schema nature                  |                     |         |
| Scaling approach               |                     |         |

## **Assignment 4: Data Modeling Thinking**

Consider the document below:

```json
{
  "order_id": "ORD20451",
  "items": [
    { "product": "Laptop", "price": 65000 },
    { "product": "Mouse", "price": 1500 }
  ],
  "order_status": "SHIPPED",
  "delivery_time_minutes": 120
}
```

Answer the following:

1. Why is this data suitable to be stored as a **single MongoDB document**?
2. What advantage does storing `items` as an array provide?
3. How would this be more complex in a relational database?

---

## **Assignment 5: Use Case Evaluation**

For each scenario below, answer **Yes or No** for MongoDB and justify your answer:

1. An e-commerce platform with frequently changing product attributes
2. A banking system with strict transactional consistency
3. A content management system with dynamic content fields
4. A legacy system with fixed tables and reports

---

## **Assignment 6: When NOT to Use MongoDB**

Answer clearly:

1. Mention **two situations** where MongoDB is not the ideal choice.
2. Why are relational databases still preferred for systems like banking and accounting?
3. What risks might occur if MongoDB is used in the wrong scenario?

---

## **Assignment 7: Self-Reflection (Very Important)**

Without looking at notes, write short answers to:

1. What problem was MongoDB created to solve?
2. What is the biggest difference between MongoDB and SQL databases?
3. Where would you personally prefer to use MongoDB and why?

If you struggle to answer these, **revisit the introduction article before proceeding**.

## **Completion Checklist**

Before moving to the next topic, you should be able to:

* Explain MongoDB in simple terms
* Differentiate MongoDB from relational databases
* Identify correct use cases for MongoDB
* Understand the document-collection-database hierarchy
