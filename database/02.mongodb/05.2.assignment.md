# **Assignment – Reading Documents in MongoDB (Basic Queries)**

This assignment is designed to help you **practice reading data**, not just understand it.

You will:

* insert multiple documents
* read them using `find()` and `findOne()`
* observe how MongoDB behaves with data types and arrays

---

## **Part A – Insert Practice Data (Mandatory Setup)**

Before starting queries, insert the following documents.

### **Step 1: Select Database**

```javascript
use codinggita
```

---

### **Step 2: Insert Student Documents**

Insert **all documents below** (you may use `insertMany()`).

```javascript
db.students.insertMany([
  {
    name: "Arjun",
    rollNumber: "CG101",
    department: "CSE",
    year: 3,
    coursesEnrolled: ["DBMS", "DSA"],
    age: 22
  },
  {
    name: "Yashvi",
    rollNumber: "CG102",
    department: "CSE",
    year: 2,
    coursesEnrolled: ["Networks", "OS"],
    age: 20
  },
  {
    name: "Mahir",
    rollNumber: "CG103",
    department: "IT",
    year: 3,
    coursesEnrolled: ["DBMS", "Cloud"],
    age: 23
  },
  {
    name: "Krishna",
    rollNumber: "CG104",
    department: "CSE",
    year: 1,
    coursesEnrolled: ["Programming Basics"],
    age: 18
  }
]);
```

---

## **Part B – Basic Read Queries**

Run the following queries and **observe the output**.

1. Read **all students**

   ```javascript
   db.students.find()
   ```

2. Find students from the **CSE department**

3. Find students who are in **year 3**

4. Find students whose `coursesEnrolled` includes **DBMS**

5. Find students whose age is **22**

---

## **Part C – Using `findOne()`**

Run the following:

1. Find one student using `rollNumber = "CG102"`
2. Find one student using `name = "Krishna"`

Answer briefly:

* Did MongoDB return more than one document?
* Why is `findOne()` suitable here?

---

## **Part D – Data Type Awareness**

Try these two queries:

```javascript
db.students.find({ year: "3" })
db.students.find({ year: 3 })
```

Answer:

1. Which query returns results?
2. Why does the other query fail?

---

## **Part E – Case Sensitivity Check**

Run:

```javascript
db.students.find({ department: "cse" })
db.students.find({ department: "CSE" })
```

Answer:

1. Which query works?
2. What does this tell you about MongoDB matching?

---

## **Part F – Verify Before Update/Delete**

Answer in plain text:

1. Why should you **always run a `find()` before an update**?
2. What risk occurs if you skip the read step?

---

## **Expected Outcome After This Assignment**

You should now be able to:

* confidently use `find()` and `findOne()`
* read documents using exact-match filters
* understand how MongoDB treats data types
* verify data before modifying it
* debug “no result” queries logically
