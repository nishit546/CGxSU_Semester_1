# **Assignment – Creating Documents in MongoDB**

This assignment is designed to ensure you **understand how MongoDB inserts data**, how documents are structured, and when to use `insertOne()` vs `insertMany()`.

You must perform all tasks using the **MongoDB shell (`mongosh`)**.

---

## **Part A – Database & Collection Setup**

1. Open the MongoDB shell.

2. Switch to a database named:

   ```
   codinggita
   ```

3. Do **not** create the database manually.

4. Let MongoDB create it automatically through insert operations.

---

## **Part B – `insertOne()` Practice (Single Document Inserts)**

Insert **three separate documents**, one at a time, into a collection named `students`.

Each document must:

* Have a `name` field (string)
* Have a `year` field (number)
* Have a `coursesEnrolled` field (array)
* Have a `registrationDate` field using `new Date()`

### Requirements

* Use **three separate `insertOne()` commands**
* Do **not** reuse the same document structure exactly
* Let MongoDB generate the `_id` automatically

---

## **Part C – Observing Insert Results**

After each `insertOne()`:

1. Observe the output object returned by MongoDB.
2. Note down:

   * Whether the operation was acknowledged
   * The value of `insertedId`

### Answer in plain text:

1. What does `acknowledged: true` indicate?
2. Why does MongoDB return an `ObjectId`?

---

## **Part D – `insertMany()` Practice (Batch Inserts)**

Insert **four documents at once** into the same `students` collection using `insertMany()`.

### Conditions

* All documents must follow the same field naming style
* At least one document must include an extra field not present in the others
* All documents must use correct data types

Example extra field ideas:

* `skills`
* `internship`
* `cgpa`

---

## **Part E – Understanding Batch Insert Behavior**

After executing `insertMany()`:

Answer the following:

1. How many documents were inserted?
2. What information does MongoDB return after `insertMany()`?
3. What would happen if one document in the batch had a duplicate `_id`?

---

## **Part F – Insert Mistake Identification (Critical Thinking)**

Consider the following document:

```json
{
  "name": "Test Student",
  "year": "3",
  "coursesEnrolled": "DBMS",
  "_id": 1
}
```

### Tasks

1. Identify **at least three problems** in this document.
2. Rewrite the document correctly.
3. Explain **why manually setting `_id` is risky**.

---

## **Part G – When to Use `insertOne()` vs `insertMany()`**

Answer in your own words:

1. When should `insertOne()` be preferred?
2. When does `insertMany()` make sense?
3. Why is `insertOne()` safer for beginners?

---

## **Submission Rules**

* Do **not** submit screenshots
* Submit:

  * MongoDB commands used
  * Written answers for conceptual questions
* Use clear formatting

---

## **Learning Outcome Check**

By completing this assignment, you should now:

* Know how MongoDB creates databases and collections
* Be confident with `insertOne()`
* Understand batch inserts with `insertMany()`
* Avoid common insertion mistakes
* Choose the correct insert method intentionally
