# 🐞 Debugging in React Native

Debugging is essential in **React Native** to identify and fix errors efficiently, ensuring faster and smoother app development.  
Using **Expo CLI** further simplifies running and debugging applications by providing built-in developer tools, real-time logs, and error overlays.

## 📌 Why Debugging is Important

- Detect runtime crashes and logical bugs
- Understand unexpected UI behavior
- Track API and network failures
- Improve performance and responsiveness
- Essential skill for real-world projects & interviews

## 1️⃣ Console Logging (Basic Debugging)

The simplest and most commonly used debugging technique is logging.

```js
console.log("App executed");
console.warn("This is a warning");
console.error("Something went wrong");
```

### Why use console logging?

- Helps track app flow and execution order  
- Useful for checking variable values  
- Quick and easy during development  
- Should be removed before production to avoid unnecessary overhead  

#### Example

```js
import React from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

export default function App() {
  console.log("App executed");

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello World</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Logs appear in:

- Metro Bundler terminal  
- Android Logcat  
- Xcode console  
- Expo DevTools

## 2️⃣ React Native Debug Menu

React Native provides a built-in **Developer Menu** that helps developers debug and inspect the application during development.

### How to open:

- **Android Emulator** → `Ctrl + M` / `Cmd + M`  
- **iOS Simulator** → `Cmd + D`  
- **Physical Device** → Shake the device  

### Useful options:

- Reload App  
- Enable / Disable Fast Refresh  
- Debug JS Remotely  
- Show Performance Monitor  

---

## 3️⃣ Red Screen & LogBox

### 🔴 Red Screen

- Appears on runtime errors  
- Displays detailed error message and stack trace  
- Clickable file links help locate the exact issue  

### 🟡 LogBox (Warnings)

LogBox displays warnings related to deprecated APIs and potential issues.

```js
import { LogBox } from "react-native";
LogBox.ignoreAllLogs(); // Not recommended during learning
```
⚠️ Warnings help identify deprecated APIs and bad practices — don’t ignore them early.

---

## 4️⃣ React DevTools

React DevTools allows inspection of:

- Component tree  
- Props  
- State  
- Hooks  

### Why it’s useful:

- Debug re-render issues  
- Inspect live state changes  
- Understand component hierarchy  

💡 Works similar to React Web DevTools.

---

## 5️⃣ Network Debugging (API Issues)

When working with APIs (`fetch` / `axios`), always debug network calls.

### Check:

- Request URL  
- Headers  
- Status codes (200, 401, 500)  
- Response data  

### Common mistakes:

- Incorrect endpoint  
- Missing headers  
- Async/await not handled properly  
- State not updated after response  


💡 **Interview Tip:**  
 Network debugging is especially important when handling authentication, pagination, and error responses.

## 6️⃣ Debugging with Chrome (Remote Debugging)

React Native supports **remote debugging**, where JavaScript runs inside a **Chrome browser**.

### Steps to Enable

1. Run the app:

```bash
npm start
```

- Open Developer Menu  
- Select **Open JS Debugger** (or **Debug JS Remotely**)  

This opens a **Chrome tab** running your app’s JavaScript code.

### What you can do in Chrome DevTools:

- **Console Tab** → View logs and errors  

- **Sources Tab**
  - Enable caught exceptions  
  - Set breakpoints  
  - Step through code line by line


⚠️ **Important:**  

Remote debugging slows down the app. Disable it after debugging.

💡 **Interview Tip:**  

Remote debugging runs JavaScript outside the device, which is why it affects performance.

---

## 7️⃣ Debugging with Visual Studio Code

Using **VS Code React Native Tools**, you can debug React Native apps directly inside the editor.

### Steps

#### Install Extension:
- **React Native Tools**

#### Create `launch.json`:
- Open **Run & Debug**
- Create `launch.json`
- Select **React Native**
- Choose **Attach to Packager**

#### Enable Debugging:
- Run the app
- Enable **Debug JS Remotely**
- Click **Attach to Packager**

#### Breakpoints:
- Click next to any code line
- Execution pauses at the breakpoint
- Logs appear in the **Debug Console**

✅ Best for structured debugging and interviews.

## 8️⃣ Debugging with Flipper (Advanced)

Flipper is an advanced debugging platform by Meta.

### Features:

- Console logs  
- Network inspector  
- Layout inspector  
- Performance monitoring  
- Plugin-based debugging  

Recommended for **production-level applications**.

---

## 9️⃣ Debugging with Expo

If you are using Expo, debugging becomes even simpler.

### Expo Debugging Tools:

- Expo DevTools (browser)  
- Error overlays  
- Device logs  
- Network inspection  

```bash
npx expo start
```

## 🔟 Error Boundaries

Error Boundaries help catch JavaScript errors during rendering and prevent full app crashes.

### Benefits:

- Graceful error handling  
- Prevents white screen crashes  
- Improves user experience  

💡 **Note:**  
Error Boundaries catch **rendering errors**, not event handlers or async code.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Performance Debugging (Intro)

### Signs of performance issues:

- Slow UI  
- Lag while scrolling  
- Unnecessary re-renders  

### Basic tips:

- Avoid inline functions in JSX  
- Use `useCallback` & `useMemo`  
- Keep components small and reusable  

---

## 🔗 Best Practices for Debugging

- Start with `console.log`  
- Read error messages carefully  
- Debug one issue at a time  
- Use proper tools (DevTools, Flipper, VS Code)  
- Never ignore warnings during learning  

---

## ✅ Summary

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Console Logs | Quick debugging |
| Debug Menu | Reload & inspect |
| Chrome DevTools | Remote JS debugging |
| VS Code Tools | Breakpoints & step execution |
| React DevTools | State & props |
| Flipper | Advanced debugging |
| Expo DevTools | Expo projects |

📘 **Tip for Students:**  
Debugging is not about fixing fast — it’s about **understanding the problem deeply**.

Happy Debugging 🚀🐛
