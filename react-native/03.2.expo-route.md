# 🚀 Expo Router (File-Based Navigation)

Expo Router is a **modern navigation system** for Expo apps that uses **file and folder-based routing**, similar to **Next.js**.

Instead of manually configuring navigators (Stack, Tab, Drawer),  
**your folder structure becomes your navigation**.

---

## What is Expo Router?

**Expo Router** is an official Expo library built **on top of React Navigation**.

It allows you to:
- Create screens using files
- Navigate automatically based on file names
- Reduce boilerplate navigation code
- Build scalable apps easily

> ℹ️ Even though Expo Router hides configuration, it internally uses **React Navigation**.

---

## Why Expo Router Exists

Traditional navigation:
- Requires manual Stack/Tab/Drawer setup
- Needs multiple config files
- Can be confusing for beginners

Expo Router:
- Uses files as screens
- Automatic navigation setup
- Cleaner and more intuitive for new projects

---

## Installing Expo Router

In a **new Expo project**, Expo Router is often already included.

If not, install it using:

```bash
npx expo install expo-router
```
---

## 📁 Basic Folder Structure

Expo Router uses an **`app/`** directory.

### Example

```text
app/
├── index.js → Home screen
├── profile.js → Profile screen
├── details.js → Details screen
```

Each file automatically becomes a **screen**.
> ℹ️ `index.js` always represents the default route of a folder.

---

## 🏠 Creating Your First Screen

### Home Screen (`app/index.js`)

```jsx
import { Text, View } from "react-native";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
### Profile Screen (`app/profile.js`)

```jsx
import { Text, View } from "react-native";

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Profile Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

Navigating to `/profile` automatically shows the **Profile screen**.
> ℹ️ The URL path matches the file name inside the `app/` folder.
---

## 🔀 Navigating Between Screens

Expo Router provides the **`Link`** component and **`router`** object for navigation.

### Using `Link`

```jsx
import { Link } from "expo-router";
import { Text } from "react-native";

<Link href="/profile">
  <Text>Go to Profile</Text>
</Link>
```

### Using `router.push`
```jsx
import { router } from "expo-router";

router.push("/profile");
```

## 📚 Stack Navigation in Expo Router

Stacks are handled using **`_layout.js`** files.

### Example Stack Layout

```text
app/
├── _layout.js
├── index.js
└── details.js
```
### `_layout.js`

```jsx
import { Stack } from "expo-router";

export default function Layout() {
  return <Stack />;
}
```

Now `index.js` and `details.js` behave like **stack screens**.

> ℹ️ `_layout.js` works like a wrapper for all screens inside the same folder.
---

## 📊 Tab Navigation in Expo Router

Tabs are created using **folder groups**.

### Folder Structure

```text
app/
├── (tabs)/
│ ├── _layout.js
│ ├── home.js
│ └── profile.js
```
### Tabs Layout

```jsx
import { Tabs } from "expo-router";

export default function TabLayout() {
  return <Tabs />;
}
```
Each file inside the **`(tabs)`** folder automatically becomes a **tab**.

---

## 🔀 Dynamic Routes (Passing Params)

Expo Router supports **dynamic routing** using file names.

### File Name
```jsx
app/details/[id].js
```
### Accessing Params
```jsx
import { useLocalSearchParams } from "expo-router";
import { Text } from "react-native";

export default function Details() {
  const { id } = useLocalSearchParams();

  return <Text>Item ID: {id}</Text>;
}
```

### Navigate to:

```jsx
/details/10
```

---

## 🧰 Drawer Navigation in Expo Router (Intro)

Drawer navigation is also supported using **layouts**.

```jsx
import { Drawer } from "expo-router/drawer";

export default function DrawerLayout() {
  return <Drawer />;
}
```
> ℹ️ Drawer layouts usually wrap tabs or stack layouts, not individual screens.

## ⚖️ Expo Router vs React Navigation

| Feature | Expo Router | React Navigation |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Routing Style | File-based | Code-based |
| Setup | Minimal | Manual |
| Learning Curve | Easier | Moderate |
| Flexibility | Medium | Very High |
| Built On | React Navigation | React Navigation |

---

### Real-World App Structure (Example)
```text
app/
├── (auth)/
│ ├── login.js
│ └── register.js
├── (tabs)/
│ ├── home.js
│ ├── profile.js
│ └── settings.js
└── _layout.js
```

## ❓ When Should You Use Expo Router?

### Use **Expo Router** if:
- You are starting a **new Expo project**
- You prefer **file-based routing**
- You want **faster setup** with less configuration

  ---

## ❌ When NOT to Use Expo Router?

- Very complex legacy navigation
- Heavy custom navigation logic
- Non-Expo React Native projects

---

### Use **React Navigation directly** if:
- You need **complex navigation logic**
- You want **full control** over navigators
- You are working on an **existing project**

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

- ❌ Mixing file-based and manual navigation
- ❌ Forgetting `_layout.js`
- ❌ Placing screens outside `app/`
- ❌ Not understanding folder grouping

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Expo Router

- Keep folder structure clean
- Use meaningful file names
- Group routes logically
- Learn basic React Navigation concepts
- Use layouts for shared UI

---

## 📝 Summary

- Expo Router uses **file-based routing**
- Every file becomes a **screen**
- Built on top of **React Navigation**
- Easier for new Expo projects
- Powerful and scalable

---

📌 **Student Tip**  
Learn **React Navigation** first, then Expo Router becomes very easy.

Happy Coding! 🎯
