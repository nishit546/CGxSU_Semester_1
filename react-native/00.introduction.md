# 📱 Introduction to React Native

## What is React Native?

React Native is a **JavaScript framework** used to build **mobile applications** for **Android and iOS** using **React**.

Instead of writing separate code for Android (Java/Kotlin) and iOS (Swift/Objective-C), React Native allows developers to write **one codebase** that works on **both platforms**.

👉 React Native uses **real native components**, not web views.

## Why React Native Exists (The Problem It Solves)

Before React Native:

- Android apps → Java / Kotlin
- iOS apps → Swift / Objective-C
- Two teams ❌
- Two codebases ❌
- More time & cost ❌

With React Native:

- One team ✅
- One codebase ✅
- Faster development ✅
- Lower cost ✅

## Role of React Native in App Development

React Native plays the role of:

- **Mobile App Framework**
- **Bridge between JavaScript & Native APIs**
- **UI Builder using Components**
- **Cross-platform solution**

It allows developers to:
- Access device features (Camera, Storage, GPS)
- Build smooth UIs
- Reuse business logic across platforms

---

## How React Native Works (High Level)

React Native works using **three main parts**:

1. **JavaScript Thread**
   - Runs your React code (state, props, logic)

2. **Bridge**
   - Communicates between JS and Native code

3. **Native Thread**
   - Renders real Android/iOS UI components

So when you write:

```js
<Text>Hello</Text>
```

Gets converted into:

- **Android** → TextView
- **iOS** → UILabel

## ✅ Why We Use React Native

### Advantages

- Cross-platform (Android + iOS)
- High code reusability (up to 90%)
- Uses React concepts
- Hot Reloading
- Strong community
- Backed by Meta (Facebook)

### Limitations

- Not ideal for heavy games
- Native code knowledge sometimes required
- Slightly less performant than pure native (but very close)

## ⚔️ React JS vs React Native

| Feature | React JS | React Native |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Platform | Web | Mobile (Android / iOS) |
| Output | HTML | Native UI |
| UI Elements | div, span, button | View, Text, Pressable |
| Styling | CSS | StyleSheet (JavaScript) |
| Navigation | React Router | React Navigation |
| DOM | Uses Browser DOM | No DOM |
| Deployment | Browser | App Store / Play Store |

## 💻 Code Example

### React JS
```jsx
<div>Hello</div>
```
### React Native

```jsx
<Text>Hello</Text>
```

## 🧱 Core Building Blocks of React Native

### Components

Everything in React Native is a **component**.

Common components:

- View
- Text
- Image
- ScrollView
- Pressable

## 🎨 Styling

React Native uses **JavaScript-based styling**:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: "blue",
  },
});
```


## 🚀 Expo vs React Native CLI (Short Intro)

### Expo

- Beginner-friendly
- No Android Studio / Xcode required
- Fast setup

### React Native CLI

- Full native control
- Used in large production apps
- Requires native setup

👉 **Beginners should start with Expo**

---

## 📍 Where React Native is Used (Real Apps)

- Facebook
- Instagram
- WhatsApp
- Discord
- Uber Eats

---

## 👨‍🎓 Who Should Learn React Native?

React Native is perfect for:

- React developers
- Web developers moving to mobile
- Startups
- Students learning cross-platform apps

---

## ❌ When NOT to Use React Native?

Avoid React Native if:

- You are building a 3D game
- You need very low-level hardware control
- App is extremely performance-critical

---

## 📝 Summary

- React Native lets you build **real mobile apps** using JavaScript
- One codebase for Android & iOS
- Uses React concepts
- Faster, cheaper, and scalable
- Best choice for modern mobile app development 🚀

📌 **Tip for Students**  
If you know **React JS**, learning React Native is **60–70% easier**.

Happy Coding! 🎯
