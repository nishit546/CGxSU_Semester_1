# 📱 Introduction to React Native

## What is React Native?

React Native is a **JavaScript framework** used to build **mobile applications** for **Android and iOS** using **React**.

Instead of writing separate code for Android (Java/Kotlin) and iOS (Swift/Objective-C), React Native allows developers to write **one codebase** that works on **both platforms**.

👉 React Native uses **real native components**, not web views.

---

## Why React Native Exists (The Problem It Solves)

Before React Native:

- Android apps → Java / Kotlin
- iOS apps → Swift / Objective-C
- Two teams ❌
- Two codebases ❌
- More time & cost ❌

With React Native:

- One team ✅
- One codebase ✅
- Faster development ✅
- Lower cost ✅

---

## Role of React Native in App Development

React Native plays the role of:

- **Mobile App Framework**
- **Bridge between JavaScript & Native APIs**
- **UI Builder using Components**
- **Cross-platform solution**

It allows developers to:
- Access device features (Camera, Storage, GPS)
- Build smooth UIs
- Reuse business logic across platforms

---

## How React Native Works (High Level)

React Native works using **three main parts**:

1. **JavaScript Thread**
   - Runs your React code (state, props, logic)

2. **Bridge**
   - Communicates between JS and Native code

3. **Native Thread**
   - Renders real Android/iOS UI components

So when you write:

```js
<Text>Hello</Text>
```

Gets converted into:

- **Android** → TextView
- **iOS** → UILabel

## ✅ Why We Use React Native

### Advantages

- Cross-platform (Android + iOS)
- High code reusability (up to 90%)
- Uses React concepts
- Hot Reloading
- Strong community
- Backed by Meta (Facebook)

### Limitations

- Not ideal for heavy games
- Native code knowledge sometimes required
- Slightly less performant than pure native (but very close)

## ⚔️ React JS vs React Native

| Feature | React JS | React Native |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Platform | Web | Mobile (Android / iOS) |
| Output | HTML | Native UI |
| UI Elements | div, span, button | View, Text, Pressable |
| Styling | CSS | StyleSheet (JavaScript) |
| Navigation | React Router | React Navigation |
| DOM | Uses Browser DOM | No DOM |
| Deployment | Browser | App Store / Play Store |


## 💻 Code Example

### React JS
```jsx
<div>Hello</div>
```
### React Native

```jsx
<Text>Hello</Text>
```
---

## ⚖️ React Native vs Flutter

Both React Native and Flutter are popular frameworks for building **cross-platform mobile apps**, but they work in different ways.

| Feature | React Native | Flutter |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Developed By | Meta (Facebook) | Google |
| Language | JavaScript / TypeScript | Dart |
| UI Rendering | Uses native UI components | Uses its own rendering engine |
| Performance | Near-native | Very close to native |
| Learning Curve | Easy (for React/JS devs) | Moderate (new language) |
| Hot Reload | Yes | Yes |
| Platform Support | Android, iOS | Android, iOS, Web, Desktop |
| Community | Very large | Growing fast |

### Key Differences Explained

- **React Native**
  - Best for developers who already know **React or JavaScript**
  - Uses real native components
  - Easier integration with existing web projects

- **Flutter**
  - Uses **Dart**, which most developers must learn
  - UI looks the same across platforms
  - Excellent performance for complex animations
 
 ---

### Which One Should You Choose?

- Choose **React Native** if:
  - You already know React or JavaScript
  - You want faster onboarding
  - You plan to reuse web knowledge

- Choose **Flutter** if:
  - You want full UI control
  - You don’t mind learning Dart
  - You want consistent UI across platforms
 
    
## 🧱 Core Building Blocks of React Native

### Components

Everything in React Native is a **component**.

Common components:

- View
- Text
- Image
- ScrollView
- Pressable

## 🎨 Styling

React Native uses **JavaScript-based styling**:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: "blue",
  },
});
```


## 🚀 Expo vs React Native CLI (Short Intro)

### Expo

- Beginner-friendly
- No Android Studio / Xcode required
- Fast setup

### React Native CLI

- Full native control
- Used in large production apps
- Requires native setup

👉 **Beginners should start with Expo**

---

## 🚀 Creating & Running Your First React Native App (Expo)

### 1️⃣ Create a New Expo Project

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest myApp
```
Move into the project folder:

```bash
cd myApp
```

### 2️⃣ Start the Expo Development Server

Run the following command:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This opens **Expo Dev Tools** in your browser.

---

### 3️⃣ Run App on Your Phone using Expo Go 📱

#### Install Expo Go:
- **Android** → Google Play Store  
- **iOS** → App Store  

#### Steps to run the app:
1. Connect your phone and laptop to the **same Wi-Fi network**
2. Open **Expo Go** on your phone
3. Scan the **QR code** shown in the terminal or browser

✅ Your app runs instantly on your phone — **no APK, no Play Store upload needed**.
