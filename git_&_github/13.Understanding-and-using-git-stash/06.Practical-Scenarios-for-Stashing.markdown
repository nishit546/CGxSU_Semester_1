# ⚠️ Practical Scenarios for Using Stash – 

## 📌 What are Practical Scenarios for Stashing?

Stashing is a lifesaver in real-world coding when you need to pause your work without committing. Here are common scenarios where `git stash` is useful:
1. **Switching tasks urgently**: Pause a feature to fix a bug.
2. **Pulling remote changes**: Stash local changes to avoid merge conflicts.
3. **Testing ideas**: Save experimental changes without committing.
4. **Keeping a clean commit history**: Avoid incomplete commits.

**Analogy**: In the CodingGita Hostel, stashing is like pausing your study notes to help with an urgent event setup, then resuming your studies later.

## 🛠 Scenarios with Commands

### 1. Switching Tasks Urgently
**Scenario**: You’re adding a feature to `index.html` but need to fix a bug on another branch.
- Edit `index.html`, don’t commit.
- Stash: `git stash push -m "Feature work"`.
- Switch: `git checkout bugfix-branch`.
- Fix bug, commit, push.
- Switch back: `git checkout main`.
- Apply: `git stash pop`.

### 2. Pulling Remote Changes
**Scenario**: You have uncommitted changes but need to pull updates from GitHub.
- Check: `git status` (shows local changes).
- Stash: `git stash -u` (includes untracked files).
- Pull: `git pull origin main`.
- Apply: `git stash apply`.

### 3. Testing Ideas
**Scenario**: You’re experimenting with a new design in `style.css` but aren’t sure it works.
- Edit `style.css`, stash: `git stash save "Test design"`.
- Try a different design, commit if good.
- If not, apply stash: `git stash apply`.

### 4. Keeping Clean Commit History
**Scenario**: You’re halfway through a feature but want to commit only finished work.
- Stash incomplete changes: `git stash`.
- Commit completed work.
- Apply stash: `git stash pop` to resume.

## 🔍 Real-Life Analogy

Stashing is like pausing a hostel project (e.g., decorating a room) to handle an urgent task (e.g., fixing a light). You store your decorations, fix the light, then bring the decorations back to continue.

## 🔧 Best Practices

- **Use descriptive stash messages**: Makes it easier to identify in complex projects.
- **Check before stashing**: Use `git status` to know what you’re saving.
- **Test after applying**: Ensure restored changes work as expected.
- **Combine with branches**: For long-term work, consider branching instead of stashing.

---

## 📝 Summary

- Stashing is ideal for task switching, pulling changes, testing ideas, and keeping clean commits.
- Use commands like `git stash`, `git stash -u`, `apply`, and `pop` depending on the scenario.
- It’s a temporary tool to keep your workflow flexible.

## 🏋️ Exercises and Assignments

### Exercise 1: Stashing for Task Switching
**Objective**: Simulate switching tasks with stashing.

Step-by-step:
1. Create a repo `scenario-practice` with `git init`.
2. Add `index.html` with `<h1>Hostel</h1>`, commit.
3. Create branch `bugfix`: `git branch bugfix`.
4. Edit `index.html`, add `<p>Info</p>`, stash: `git stash save "Feature info"`.
5. Switch: `git checkout bugfix`.
6. Add `fix.txt`, commit.
7. Switch back: `git checkout main`.
8. Pop: `git stash pop`.
   - **Explanation**: Restores `<p>Info</p>` and removes stash.
9. Check: `git status`.

**Expected Learning**: Use stash to pause and resume tasks.

### Exercise 2: Stashing for Pulling Changes
**Objective**: Stash to pull remote updates.

Step-by-step:
1. Clone a GitHub repo or simulate one locally in `scenario-practice`.
2. Edit `index.html`, add `<footer>End</footer>`, don’t commit.
3. Create `new.txt`, don’t add.
4. Stash: `git stash -u -m "Footer and new file"`.
5. Simulate pull: Add a new commit to `main` (or pull if using a real remote).
6. Apply: `git stash apply`.
7. Check: `git status` (shows restored files).

**Expected Learning**: Avoid conflicts when pulling.

### Assignment: Stashing in a Team Project
**Objective**: Apply stashing in multiple scenarios.

1. Create a repo `hostel-team` with `git init`.
2. Add `main.html` with `<h1>Team Page</h1>`, commit.
3. Edit `main.html`, add `<p>Team Info</p>`, stash as “Team info”.
4. Create `bug.css`, stash with `-u` as “Bug styling”.
5. Simulate a pull by adding a commit to `main.html`.
6. Apply “Team info” stash, then pop “Bug styling” stash.
7. Write a note explaining how stashing helped in both scenarios.
