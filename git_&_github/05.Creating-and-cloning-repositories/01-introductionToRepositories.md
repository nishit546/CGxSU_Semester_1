# What is a Repository?

A **repository (repo) in Git** is like a storage space where your project files live.  
It not only stores the files but also keeps track of all the changes made to them over time.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as a special folder that remembers every version of your project.

## ðŸ“Œ Real-life Examples

### Classroom Notebook Example

- Imagine you have a notebook for your class assignments.
- On page 1, you wrote Assignment 1.
- On page 2, you wrote Assignment 2.
- If you make corrections, you donâ€™t throw the old notebook away. You keep the changes inside the same notebook.
- **Similarly, a Git repository keeps all versions of your project safely stored.**

### Google Docs Example

- When you type in **Google Docs**:
  - It saves your work.
  - You can see older versions by clicking on "Version History."
  - You can go back to an earlier version anytime.
- **A Git repository works the same way for your code or project files.**

## ðŸ“Œ Types of Repositories in Git

- **Local Repository**  
  Stored on your computer.  
  Example: A folder on your laptop where youâ€™re working on a project.

- **Remote Repository**  
  Stored on the internet (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).  
  Example: Like uploading your project to Google Drive so you can share it with friends.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Do We Need a Repository?

- To organize project files in one place.
- To track changes and go back to old versions.
- To collaborate with others (friends, teammates, or the whole world).
- To share your project online (like GitHub).

âœ… **So, a repository = project folder + history of all changes.**
