# üîÑ Switching Branches: `git checkout` and `git switch`

## üéØ What is Switching Branches?

Switching branches means **moving from one branch to another** in your Git repository. It's like changing your "working context" - you're now working on a different version of your project.

Think of it as **switching rooms** in a house - each room (branch) has different furniture and decorations!

## üîç How Branch Switching Works

### **What Happens When You Switch Branches:**
1. **Git updates your working directory** with files from the target branch
2. **Your current branch changes** to the new branch
3. **All files are updated** to match the target branch
4. **You can now work** on the new branch

### **Visual Representation:**
```
Before switching:
main: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C (you're here, working on main)

After: git checkout feature/login
feature/login: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D (you're now here, working on feature)
main: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C (main branch unchanged)
```

## üöÄ Branch Switching Commands

### **Method 1: Git Checkout (Traditional)**
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>    # Switch to existing branch
```

### **Method 2: Git Switch (Modern, Git 2.23+)**
```bash
git switch <branch-name>      # Switch to existing branch
```

### **Examples:**
```bash
# Using git checkout
git checkout feature/login
git checkout bugfix/nav-error
git checkout main

# Using git switch (modern)
git switch feature/login
git switch bugfix/nav-error
git switch main
```

## üí° When to Switch Branches

### **1. Starting Work on a Feature**
```bash
# You're on main, want to work on login feature
git checkout feature/user-login
# Now you're working on the login feature branch
```

### **2. Switching Between Different Features**
```bash
# Working on multiple features
git checkout feature/user-profile    # Work on user profiles
git checkout feature/course-catalog  # Switch to course catalog
git checkout feature/grade-display   # Switch to grade display
```

### **3. Going Back to Main**
```bash
# Finished feature work, return to main
git checkout main
# Now you're back on the main branch
```

### **4. Switching to Bug Fixes**
```bash
# Need to fix a bug while working on feature
git checkout bugfix/login-error
# Now you're working on the bug fix
```

## üîß Checking Your Current Branch

### **See Which Branch You're On**
```bash
git branch                    # List branches, * shows current
git branch --show-current     # Show only current branch name
git status                    # Shows current branch in status
```

### **Example Output:**
```bash
git branch

# Output:
  main
* feature/user-login          # Asterisk (*) shows current branch
  bugfix/nav-error
  experiment/dark-mode
```

## üì± Real-Life Examples

### **Example 1: Feature Development Workflow**
```bash
# Start on main branch
git checkout main
git status                    # Shows "On branch main"

# Switch to feature branch
git checkout feature/user-login
git status                    # Shows "On branch feature/user-login"

# Work on login feature...
# Switch back to main
git checkout main
git status                    # Shows "On branch main"
```

### **Example 2: Bug Fix Scenario**
```bash
# Working on feature, but urgent bug found
git checkout feature/user-profile
# Working on user profile feature...

# Urgent bug needs fixing
git checkout bugfix/security-issue
# Fix the security issue...

# Return to feature work
git checkout feature/user-profile
# Continue with user profile feature
```

### **Example 3: Multiple Feature Development**
```bash
# Start on main
git checkout main

# Work on navigation feature
git checkout feature/navigation
# Make changes, commit...

# Switch to contact form feature
git checkout feature/contact-form
# Make changes, commit...

# Switch back to navigation
git checkout feature/navigation
# Continue navigation work
```

## üö´ Common Mistakes and Solutions

### **Mistake 1: Switching with Uncommitted Changes**
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong: Switching with uncommitted changes
git status                   # Shows modified files
git checkout feature/login   # Error: cannot switch

# ‚úÖ Solution 1: Commit changes first
git add .
git commit -m "Save current work"
git checkout feature/login

# ‚úÖ Solution 2: Stash changes temporarily
git stash
git checkout feature/login
git stash pop               # Apply changes on new branch
```

### **Mistake 2: Switching to Non-existent Branch**
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong: Trying to switch to branch that doesn't exist
git checkout feature/does-not-exist
# Error: branch not found

# ‚úÖ Solution: Create the branch first
git checkout -b feature/does-not-exist
# Creates and switches to new branch
```

### **Mistake 3: Forgetting Which Branch You're On**
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong: Working without knowing your branch
# Make changes, commit, then realize you're on wrong branch

# ‚úÖ Solution: Always check your current branch
git branch --show-current    # Shows current branch
git status                   # Shows branch and status
```

## üéÆ Step-by-Step Branch Switching

### **Step 1: Check Current Status**
```bash
git status                   # See current branch and changes
git branch                   # List all branches
```

### **Step 2: Handle Any Uncommitted Changes**
```bash
# If you have changes, either:
git add . && git commit -m "Save work"  # Commit changes
# OR
git stash                   # Stash changes temporarily
```

### **Step 3: Switch to Target Branch**
```bash
git checkout feature/login  # Switch to feature branch
# OR
git switch feature/login    # Modern way
```

### **Step 4: Verify the Switch**
```bash
git branch --show-current   # Confirm new branch
git status                  # Shows new branch
```

## üîç Advanced Branch Switching

### **Switch and Create in One Step**
```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch>    # Create and switch to new branch
git switch -c <new-branch>      # Modern way
```

### **Switch to Previous Branch**
```bash
git checkout -                 # Switch to previous branch
git switch -                   # Modern way
```

### **Switch to Remote Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/login origin/feature/login
# Create local branch tracking remote branch
```

## üéØ Git Checkout vs Git Switch

### **Git Checkout (Traditional)**
```bash
git checkout <branch>           # Switch to branch
git checkout -b <branch>        # Create and switch
git checkout <file>             # Restore file (different purpose)
```

### **Git Switch (Modern)**
```bash
git switch <branch>             # Switch to branch
git switch -c <branch>          # Create and switch
git switch -                    # Switch to previous
```

### **Why Git Switch is Better:**
- **More specific** - only for branch operations
- **Less confusing** - doesn't have multiple purposes
- **Safer** - won't accidentally restore files
- **Clearer intent** - obvious what you're trying to do

## üéØ Key Takeaways

- **`git checkout <branch>`** switches to existing branch
- **`git switch <branch>`** is the modern, preferred way
- **Check current branch** before switching
- **Handle uncommitted changes** before switching
- **Verify the switch** after changing branches
- **Use descriptive branch names** for clarity
