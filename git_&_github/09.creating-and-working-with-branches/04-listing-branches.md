# üìã Listing Branches: `git branch`

## üéØ What is `git branch`?

The `git branch` command shows you **all the branches** in your Git repository. It's like having a **directory of all the rooms** in your project house - you can see what exists and which room you're currently in.

Think of it as your **branch navigation system** - it helps you understand the structure of your project!

## üîç Basic Branch Listing

### **List Local Branches**
```bash
git branch                    # Show all local branches
```

### **What You See:**
```bash
git branch

# Output:
* main                    # Asterisk (*) shows current branch
  feature/user-login
  bugfix/nav-error
  experiment/dark-mode
```

### **Understanding the Output:**
- **Asterisk (*)** = Current branch (where you are now)
- **Branch names** = All available local branches
- **Indentation** = Shows hierarchy (main is usually first)

## üöÄ Advanced Branch Listing Options

### **1. Show All Branches (Local + Remote)**
```bash
git branch -a                # Show all branches
git branch --all             # Same as -a
```

### **2. Show Only Remote Branches**
```bash
git branch -r                # Show only remote branches
git branch --remotes         # Same as -r
```

### **3. Show Current Branch Only**
```bash
git branch --show-current    # Show only current branch name
```

### **4. Show Branch Details**
```bash
git branch -v                # Show branches with last commit
git branch --verbose         # Same as -v
```

### **5. Show Branch Information**
```bash
git branch -vv               # Show tracking information
git branch --verbose --verbose
```

## üì± Real-Life Examples

### **Example 1: Basic Branch Overview**
```bash
# You're working on a student portal project
git branch

# Output:
* main
  feature/user-login
  feature/course-registration
  bugfix/nav-overlap
```

**What this tells you:**
- You're currently on the `main` branch
- You have 3 feature/bug fix branches
- Your project is well-organized with separate branches

### **Example 2: Checking Remote Branches**
```bash
# See what's available on the remote repository
git branch -a

# Output:
* main
  feature/user-login
  feature/course-registration
  bugfix/nav-overlap
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/feature/user-login
  remotes/origin/feature/course-registration
```

**What this tells you:**
- Local branches you have
- Remote branches available
- Which branches are synced with remote

### **Example 3: Detailed Branch Information**
```bash
# See branches with commit information
git branch -v

# Output:
* main                    abc1234 Initial project setup
  feature/user-login      def5678 Add login form
  feature/course-reg      ghi9012 Start course registration
  bugfix/nav-overlap      jkl3456 Fix navigation overlap
```

**What this tells you:**
- Current branch (main)
- Last commit hash and message for each branch
- Progress on each feature/bug fix

## üîß Understanding Branch Status

### **Current Branch Indicators**
```bash
git branch

# Output examples:
* main                    # You're on main branch
  feature/login           # feature/login exists but you're not on it
  bugfix/nav-error        # bugfix/nav-error exists but you're not on it
```

### **Branch Synchronization Status**
```bash
git branch -vv

# Output:
* main                    abc1234 [origin/main] Initial setup
  feature/login           def5678 [origin/feature/login] Add login form
  bugfix/nav-error        ghi9012 [ahead 2] Fix navigation error
```

**What this tells you:**
- `[origin/main]` = Branch is synced with remote
- `[ahead 2]` = Local branch has 2 commits ahead of remote
- `[behind 1]` = Local branch is 1 commit behind remote

## üí° When to Use Different Listing Options

### **Daily Work - Basic Listing**
```bash
git branch                    # Quick overview of your branches
```

### **Planning Work - Detailed Information**
```bash
git branch -v                # See progress on each branch
```

### **Team Collaboration - Remote Information**
```bash
git branch -a                # See what others are working on
```

### **Debugging - Tracking Information**
```bash
git branch -vv               # See branch relationships
```

## üéØ Branch Naming Patterns

### **Common Branch Types:**
```bash
git branch

# Output:
* main
  feature/user-authentication
  feature/course-catalog
  bugfix/login-validation
  hotfix/security-issue
  experiment/dark-mode
```

### **Understanding the Pattern:**
- **`main`** = Default/stable branch
- **`feature/*`** = New functionality being developed
- **`bugfix/*`** = Bug fixes
- **`hotfix/*`** = Urgent fixes
- **`experiment/*`** = Testing new ideas

## üö´ Common Mistakes and Solutions

### **Mistake 1: Not Understanding Current Branch**
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong: Working without knowing your branch
git status                   # Shows "On branch feature/login"
# But you thought you were on main!

# ‚úÖ Solution: Always check current branch
git branch --show-current    # Shows: feature/login
```

### **Mistake 2: Ignoring Remote Branches**
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong: Only looking at local branches
git branch                   # Only shows local branches
# Missing important remote information

# ‚úÖ Solution: Check all branches
git branch -a                # Shows local + remote
```

### **Mistake 3: Not Understanding Branch Status**
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong: Not checking if branches are synced
git branch                   # Shows branches but not sync status

# ‚úÖ Solution: Check tracking information
git branch -vv               # Shows sync status
```

## üéÆ Step-by-Step Branch Exploration

### **Step 1: Basic Branch Overview**
```bash
git branch                    # See all local branches
```

### **Step 2: Check Current Branch**
```bash
git branch --show-current     # Confirm which branch you're on
```

### **Step 3: See Remote Branches**
```bash
git branch -a                 # See local + remote branches
```

### **Step 4: Get Detailed Information**
```bash
git branch -v                 # See branches with commit info
git branch -vv                # See tracking information
```

## üîç Advanced Branch Listing Techniques

### **Filter Branches by Pattern**
```bash
git branch | grep feature     # Show only feature branches
git branch | grep bugfix      # Show only bug fix branches
```

### **Sort Branches by Date**
```bash
git branch --sort=-committerdate  # Sort by newest first
git branch --sort=committerdate   # Sort by oldest first
```

### **Show Merged/Unmerged Branches**
```bash
git branch --merged           # Show branches merged into current
git branch --no-merged        # Show branches not merged
```

## üéØ Key Takeaways

- **`git branch`** shows all local branches
- **`git branch -a`** shows local + remote branches
- **`git branch -v`** shows branches with commit info
- **`git branch --show-current`** shows current branch
- **Asterisk (*)** indicates current branch
- **Check branch status regularly** to stay organized
