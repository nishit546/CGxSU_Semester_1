# üîÄ Merging a Branch into `main`

## üéØ Goal
Take all the work from a feature branch (e.g., `feature-branch`) and combine it into the `main` branch‚Äîsafely and cleanly.

---

## ‚úÖ Essential CLI Flow

### Complete Step-by-Step Process
```bash
# 0) Pre-check: on feature branch, ensure tests pass
git checkout feature-branch
# run tests or manual checks

# 1) Update target (main)
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2) Merge the feature into main
git merge feature-branch

# 3) Push the merged main
git push origin main
```

### What Happens at Each Step
1. **Pre-check**: Verify your feature branch is ready for merging
2. **Update main**: Ensure you're merging into the latest version
3. **Merge**: Combine the feature changes into main
4. **Push**: Share the merged changes with your team

### Notes
- If histories didn't diverge: **fast-forward** (no merge commit)
- If both sides changed: Git creates a **merge commit** or asks you to resolve conflicts

---

## üß≠ Pre‚ÄëMerge Checklist (Highly Recommended)

### Feature Branch Preparation
Before merging, ensure your feature branch is ready:

#### Code Quality Checks
- [ ] All work committed with clear, descriptive messages
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Linting/formatting checks pass
- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] Manual testing completed

#### Git Status Checks
```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status

# Check commit history
git log --oneline -10

# Check if branch is up to date with main
git fetch origin
git log main..feature-branch --oneline
```

### Main Branch Preparation
Ensure the target branch is ready to receive changes:

#### Update and Verify
- [ ] Main branch is up to date: `git pull origin main`
- [ ] No uncommitted changes on main
- [ ] Protected branch permissions (if applicable)

---

## üîß Keeping Feature Up to Date

### Why Update Before Merging?
Updating your feature branch with the latest `main` changes helps:
- Reduce merge conflicts
- Ensure compatibility
- Make the final merge smoother

### Two Common Approaches

#### Method 1: Merge main into feature
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
# resolve conflicts if any, then commit
```

**Pros**: Preserves exact history, easier to understand
**Cons**: Can create extra merge commits in feature branch

#### Method 2: Rebase feature onto main (linearize)
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# resolve conflicts, then continue
# if needed: git rebase --continue | --abort
```

**Pros**: Creates cleaner, linear history
**Cons**: Rewrites commit history, requires coordination if branch is shared

### When to Use Each Method
- **Use merge** when:
  - Feature branch is shared with others
  - You want to preserve exact history
  - You're less comfortable with rebase

- **Use rebase** when:
  - Feature branch is only local
  - You want linear history
  - You're comfortable with rebase workflow

## üß± Resolving Conflicts During Merge

### Understanding Merge Conflicts
Conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes because:
- Both branches modified the same lines
- One branch deleted a file that another modified
- Changes are too close together for Git to safely combine

### Step-by-Step Conflict Resolution

#### 1. Identify Conflicted Files
```bash
# After git merge feature-branch if conflicts occur:
git status
# Shows files with conflicts
```

#### 2. Open and Resolve Conflicts
Open each conflicted file and look for conflict markers:
```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Code from current branch (main)
=======
// Code from feature branch
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

#### 3. Edit Files to Resolve
- Remove conflict markers
- Choose the correct code or combine both versions
- Ensure the final result makes sense

#### 4. Stage Resolved Files
```bash
git add <file1> <file2>
# Add all resolved files
```

#### 5. Complete the Merge
```bash
git commit   # Git creates a merge commit
```

### If You Want to Stop and Retry
```bash
git merge --abort  # Returns to pre-merge state
```

### Conflict Resolution Best Practices
- **Understand the changes**: Don't just pick one side blindly
- **Test after resolution**: Ensure the merged code still works
- **Communicate with team**: If unsure about which changes to keep
- **Use merge tools**: Consider using VS Code, GitKraken, or other GUI tools

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª GitHub Pull Request Flow (Beginner Friendly)

### What Are Pull Requests?
Pull Requests (PRs) are GitHub's way of proposing changes before merging. They provide:
- **Code Review**: Team members can review your changes
- **CI/CD**: Automated tests run before merging
- **Discussion**: Comments and suggestions on specific code
- **Merge Options**: Choose how to merge

### Complete PR Workflow

#### 1. Prepare Your Feature Branch
```bash
# Ensure your branch is up to date
git checkout feature-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main  # or git merge origin/main
```

#### 2. Push to Remote
```bash
git push -u origin feature-branch
```

#### 3. Create Pull Request
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Click "Compare & pull request" button
- Select source branch (`feature-branch`) and target branch (`main`)
- Add descriptive title and description
- Request reviewers if applicable

#### 4. Review Process
- Address any CI/CD failures
- Respond to reviewer comments
- Make additional commits if needed

#### 5. Choose Merge Method
When ready to merge, choose from:
- **Merge commit**: Preserve both histories (default)
- **Squash**: Combine all feature commits into one
- **Rebase & merge**: Linearize commits, then fast-forward

#### 6. Complete the PR
- Click "Merge pull request"
- Delete the branch when prompted

### PR Best Practices
- **Keep PRs small**: Easier to review and merge
- **Write clear descriptions**: Explain what and why
- **Request specific reviewers**: Choose people familiar with the code
- **Respond to feedback**: Address comments promptly

## üîç Verification & Cleanup

### Verifying the Merge
After merging, verify everything worked correctly:

#### Check Git History
```bash
# View recent commits including merge
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --max-count=20

# Show the merge commit details
git show <merge-commit-hash>
```

#### Check File Contents
```bash
# Verify files are as expected
git status
git diff HEAD~1  # Compare with commit before merge
```

#### Run Tests
```bash
# Ensure the merged code still works
npm test  # or your project's test command
npm run build  # or your build command
```

### Cleanup After Merge

#### Delete Local Branch
```bash
git branch -d feature-branch  # Delete local branch
```

#### Delete Remote Branch
```bash
git push origin --delete feature-branch  # Delete remote branch
```

#### Update Local Repository
```bash
# Fetch latest changes and prune deleted remote branches
git fetch --prune
```

### When to Keep Branches
Consider keeping branches if:
- They represent long-lived features (e.g., `develop`, `staging`)
- They're used for release management
- They contain work that might be needed later

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Policies & Tips

### Branch Protection
Protect your `main` branch to ensure quality:

#### GitHub Branch Protection
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict direct pushes to main

#### Local Policies
- Always pull latest main before merging
- Test merged code before pushing
- Use meaningful commit messages

### Best Practices for Smooth Merges

#### Keep Branches Focused
- **Single responsibility**: Each branch should do one thing
- **Small scope**: Smaller changes are easier to merge
- **Regular updates**: Keep feature branches updated with main

#### Communication
- **Coordinate with team**: Let others know when you're merging
- **Document decisions**: Explain merge choices in commit messages
- **Review conflicts**: Don't resolve conflicts in isolation

#### Testing
- **Test before merge**: Ensure feature works on its own
- **Test after merge**: Verify everything still works together
- **Automated testing**: Use CI/CD to catch issues early
