# üîó What Is Merging?

## üéØ Simple Definition
Merging in Git means **combining changes from one branch into another**. It brings the work done on a feature or bugfix branch back into the target branch (often `main`).

Think of merging as **mixing two notebooks** into one final notebook without losing any pages.

---

## üß† Deeper Understanding

### What Happens During a Merge
When you merge branches, Git performs a **3-way merge**:
1. **Common Ancestor**: The commit where the branches diverged
2. **Source Branch**: The branch you're merging from (e.g., `feature/login`)
3. **Target Branch**: The branch you're merging into (e.g., `main`)

Git compares these three points to determine:
- Which changes to keep
- Which changes conflict
- How to combine everything safely

### Merge vs Rebase (High Level)
- **Merge**: Keeps both histories and adds a merge commit (non-ff)
- **Rebase**: Rewrites the feature history onto `main` (linearizes); then a fast-forward merge is possible

---

## üèóÔ∏è Typical CLI Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process
```bash
# 1) Create a branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/login
# ... add commits ...

# 2) Switch to target branch
git checkout main

# 3) Merge the feature back
git merge feature/login

# 4) Push updated main
git push origin main
```

### Visual Representation
```
Before Merge:
main:    A ‚Äî B ‚Äî C
              \
feature:        D ‚Äî E

After Merge:
main:    A ‚Äî B ‚Äî C ‚Äî M
                         \     /
                        D ‚Äî E
(M is the merge commit combining histories)
```

## üß≠ When Do We Merge?

### Common Scenarios
- **After completing a feature** or bugfix branch
- **To bring long-lived branches** together (e.g., `develop` ‚Üí `main`)
- **After review and tests pass** (often via Pull Requests)
- **When syncing branches** with different histories

### Real-Life Examples
- **Feature Development**: Merge `feature/user-authentication` into `main`
- **Bug Fixes**: Merge `bugfix/login-validation` into `main`
- **Hotfixes**: Merge `hotfix/security-patch` into `main`
- **Release Branches**: Merge `release/v2.0` into `main`

## üß∞ Command Cheat Sheet

### Essential Merge Commands
```bash
# Switch to target branch (usually main)
git checkout main

# Update target with remote changes
git pull origin main

# Merge source branch into target
git merge feature-branch

# Finish: push merged target
git push origin main
```

### Visualization Commands
```bash
# Visualize history with merges
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all

# Show merge commits only
git log --merges --oneline

# Show detailed merge information
git show <merge-commit-hash>
```

### Merge Control Commands
```bash
# Abort a merge in progress
git merge --abort

# Continue after fixing conflicts
git add <files>
git commit   # completes the merge commit

# Force a specific merge strategy
git merge --no-ff feature-branch    # Always create merge commit
git merge --ff-only feature-branch  # Only allow fast-forward
```

## üß± Conflicts: What, Why, How

### What Are Conflicts?
Conflicts happen when the **same lines** or **closely related chunks** changed on both branches. Git cannot automatically determine which version to keep.

### Why Conflicts Occur
- **Same file, same line**: Both branches modified the exact same line
- **Adjacent changes**: Changes are close enough that Git can't safely combine them
- **File deletion**: One branch deleted a file, another modified it

### How to Resolve Conflicts
```bash
# 1) Git marks conflicts in files with special markers
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Code from current branch (main)
=======
// Code from feature branch
>>>>>>> feature/login

# 2) Edit files to resolve conflicts
# 3) Stage resolved files
git add <resolved-files>

# 4) Complete the merge
git commit   # Git creates a merge commit
```

### If You Want to Stop
```bash
git merge --abort  # Returns to pre-merge state
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Pull Requests (GitHub/GitLab) Context

### What Are Pull Requests?
Pull Requests (PRs) are GitHub's way of proposing changes before merging. They provide:
- **Code Review**: Team members can review your changes
- **CI/CD**: Automated tests run before merging
- **Discussion**: Comments and suggestions on specific code
- **Merge Options**: Choose how to merge

### Opening a PR
1. Push your feature branch to remote
2. Go to GitHub and click "New Pull Request"
3. Select source branch (`feature/login`) and target branch (`main`)
4. Add description and request reviewers

### Merge Methods on Platforms
- **Merge commit**: Preserve both histories (default)
- **Squash merge**: Combine all feature commits into one
- **Rebase and merge**: Linearize commits, then fast-forward

### Choosing Merge Strategy
- **Merge commit**: For complex features with multiple commits
- **Squash**: For simple features; keeps main history clean
- **Rebase**: For linear history; requires coordination if branch is shared

## ‚ùó Common Pitfalls

### 1. Merging Outdated Branches
**Problem**: Merging a feature branch that hasn't been updated with latest `main`
**Solution**: Update your feature branch first
```bash
git checkout feature/login
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main  # or git rebase origin/main
```

### 2. Ignoring Conflicts
**Problem**: Rushing through conflict resolution without understanding
**Solution**: Take time to understand what changed and why

### 3. Large Feature Branches
**Problem**: Trying to merge a branch with many changes
**Solution**: Break into smaller, focused branches

### 4. Mixing Unrelated Changes
**Problem**: One branch contains multiple unrelated features
**Solution**: Keep branches focused on single features

---

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### "Do I lose my branch after merging?"
**Answer**: No. Your feature branch remains intact. You can delete it manually if desired:
```bash
git branch -d feature/login          # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature/login  # Delete remote branch
```

### "Why does Git create a merge commit?"
**Answer**: Because both branches diverged. Git records the join point to preserve history.

### "What's the difference from fast-forward?"
**Answer**: Fast-forward happens when target has no new commits since branching. No merge commit needed.

### "Can I undo a merge?"
**Answer**: Yes, but be careful:
```bash
# Safe way (for shared branches)
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

# Dangerous way (only for local branches)
git reset --hard <commit-before-merge>
```

### Exercise 5: Undo a Merge Safely
**Objective**: Learn how to safely undo merges.

**Prerequisites**: 
- Completed Exercise 4
- Understanding of commit hashes

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:
1. **Identify the Merge Commit**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --merges
   # Note the hash of the merge commit you want to undo
   ```

2. **Create a Revert Commit**:
   ```bash
   git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
   # The -m 1 flag tells Git which parent to revert to
   # Parent 1 is usually the main branch
   ```

3. **Verify the Revert**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   git show HEAD
   ```

4. **Check File Contents**:
   ```bash
   cat index.html
   # Footer should be removed
   ```

5. **Push the Revert**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Merge is undone via a new commit
- History is preserved
- Changes are reverted safely

**Learning Points**:
- Safe way to undo merges
- Understanding revert vs reset
- Preserving shared history
