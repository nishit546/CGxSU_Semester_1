# Assignment 3

# State Statistics Management API

## Full REST Implementation (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

---

# 1. Objective

Design and implement a complete REST API using **Express.js** to manage statistical data of Indian states using an in-memory JSON array.

This assignment is designed to evaluate:

* Understanding of REST architecture
* Correct use of HTTP methods
* Dynamic route handling
* Data manipulation using arrays
* Proper status code usage
* Difference between PUT and PATCH
* Resource deletion logic

No database is allowed.
No authentication.
No external validation libraries.

All operations must modify the in-memory array dynamically.

---

# 2. Data Structure

Each state must follow this exact structure:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Gujarat",
  population: 63872399,
  literacyRate: 78.03,
  annualBudget: 243965,
  gdp: 21000000
}
```

Field Meaning:

* id → unique identifier (number)
* name → state name (string)
* population → total population (number)
* literacyRate → percentage (number)
* annualBudget → annual state budget in crores (number)
* gdp → state GDP in crores (number)

---

# 3. Sample JSON Data 

Students must initialize the API with at least 8 states.
```

const states = [
  { id: 1, name: "Andhra Pradesh", population: 49386799, literacyRate: 67.02, annualBudget: 279279, gdp: 14000000 },

# 4. Required Routes

---

# A. GET Routes (3 Required)

---

## 1. GET `/states`

### Purpose:

Return complete list of states.

### Expected Behavior:

* Status Code: 200
* Return full array
* JSON format only

### Concept Tested:

* Basic resource listing
* REST naming convention

---

## 2. GET `/states/:id`

### Purpose:

Return a single state by ID.

### Example:

```
GET /states/3
```

### Expected Behavior:

* If state exists → return object
* If not found → return:

  ```
  {
    message: "State not found"
  }
  ```

  with Status Code 404

### Concept Tested:

* Route parameters
* Array `find()`
* Error handling

---

## 3. GET `/states/highest-gdp`

### Purpose:

Return the state with the highest GDP.

### Expected Behavior:

* Use `reduce()` or sorting
* Return only one object
* Status 200

### Concept Tested:

* Aggregation logic
* Server-side data computation

---

# B. POST Route (1 Required)

---

## 4. POST `/states`

### Purpose:

Add a new state record.

### Request Body Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Haryana",
  "population": 25351462,
  "literacyRate": 75.55,
  "annualBudget": 180000,
  "gdp": 10000000
}
```

### Expected Behavior:

* Generate unique ID automatically
* Push into array
* Return created object
* Status Code: 201

### Concept Tested:

* `req.body`
* Auto ID generation
* Resource creation semantics

---

# C. PUT Routes (3 Required)

PUT must replace the entire resource unless otherwise specified.

---

## 5. PUT `/states/:id`

### Purpose:

Replace entire state record (except id).

### Expected Behavior:

* If state exists → replace fields
* If not → 404
* Status 200

### Concept Tested:

* Full replacement logic
* PUT semantics

---

## 6. PUT `/states/:id/budget`

### Purpose:

Replace annualBudget value.

### Request:

```json
{
  "annualBudget": 260000
}
```

### Expected:

* Update only budget
* Return updated object
* Status 200

---

## 7. PUT `/states/:id/population`

### Purpose:

Replace population value entirely.

### Concept Tested:

* Targeted replacement
* Route specialization

---

# D. PATCH Routes (3 Required)

PATCH must partially update resource.

---

## 8. PATCH `/states/:id/literacy`

Update literacyRate only.

---

## 9. PATCH `/states/:id/gdp`

Update gdp only.

---

## 10. PATCH `/states/:id`

Allow updating any provided fields without replacing entire object.

Example:

```json
{
  "annualBudget": 280000
}
```

Only update provided fields.

### Concept Tested:

* Difference between PUT and PATCH
* Partial update logic

---

# E. DELETE Routes (3 Required)

---

## 11. DELETE `/states/:id`

Delete state by ID.

* If found → remove from array
* Status 204
* If not found → 404

---

## 12. DELETE `/states/name/:stateName`

Delete state by name.

Case-insensitive comparison required.

---

## 13. DELETE `/states/low-literacy/:percentage`

Delete all states where literacyRate < given value.

Return:

```json
{
  "deletedCount": 2
}
```

### Concept Tested:

* Filtering and mutation
* Business rule logic
