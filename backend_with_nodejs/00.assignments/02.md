# Assignment 2

## E-Commerce Product API (In-Memory – GET, POST, PUT)

---

## Objective

Build a REST API using **Express.js** that manages product data for an e-commerce platform using an in-memory JSON array.

The application must:

* Implement 3 GET routes
* Implement 1 POST route
* Implement 3 PUT routes
* Follow REST principles
* Use correct HTTP status codes

No database, no validation library, no authentication.

---

# Problem Statement

Create an API that manages product listings.

Each product must follow this structure:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Wireless Mouse",
  category: "Electronics",
  price: 799,
  stock: 25,
  rating: 4.3
}
```

All logic must work dynamically using the JSON array.

---

# Sample JSON Data

```js
const products = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Wireless Mouse",
    category: "Electronics",
    price: 799,
    stock: 25,
    rating: 4.3
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Running Shoes",
    category: "Footwear",
    price: 2499,
    stock: 40,
    rating: 4.5
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Laptop Stand",
    category: "Accessories",
    price: 999,
    stock: 30,
    rating: 4.2
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "Smart Watch",
    category: "Electronics",
    price: 4999,
    stock: 12,
    rating: 4.4
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    name: "Backpack",
    category: "Fashion",
    price: 1599,
    stock: 50,
    rating: 4.1
  }
];
```

# Required Routes

---

# GET Routes (3 Required)

---

## 1. GET `/products`

Return all products.

Expected:

* Status 200
* Return full array

Tests:

* Basic route handling
* JSON response

---

## 2. GET `/products/:id`

Return product by ID.

Example:

```
GET /products/3
```

Expected:

* If found → return product object
* If not found → return 404

Tests:

* Route parameters
* `req.params`
* Array `find()`

---

## 3. GET `/products/category/:categoryName`

Return products by category.

Example:

```
GET /products/category/Electronics
```

Expected:

* Return filtered array
* If none found → return empty array

Tests:

* Filtering logic
* Clean route design

---

# POST Route (1 Required)

---

## 4. POST `/products`

Add a new product.

Example Body:

```js
{
  "name": "Bluetooth Speaker",
  "category": "Electronics",
  "price": 2999,
  "stock": 20,
  "rating": 4.6
}
```

Expected:

* Auto-generate ID
* Push to array
* Return 201 status
* Return created product

Tests:

* `req.body`
* ID generation
* Status code 201

---

# PUT Routes (3 Required)

These routes will test update logic without validation complexity.

---

## 5. PUT `/products/:id`

Replace entire product.

Expected:

* Replace all fields except ID
* 404 if product not found
* Status 200

Tests:

* Full object replacement
* Understanding PUT semantics

---

## 6. PUT `/products/:id/stock`

Update only stock value.

Example:

```
PUT /products/2/stock
```

Body:

```js
{
  "stock": 60
}
```

Expected:

* Update only stock field
* Return updated product
* 404 if not found

Tests:

* Targeted field update
* Route specialization

---

## 7. PUT `/products/:id/price`

Update only price.

Example:

```
PUT /products/3/price
```

Body:

```js
{
  "price": 1299
}
```

Expected:

* Update only price field
* Return updated product
* 404 if not found

Tests:

* Selective update logic
* Clean route design

---

# Technical Requirements

Students must:

* Use Express
* Use `express.json()`
* Use CORS middleware
* Maintain correct middleware order
* Use proper status codes (200, 201, 404)
* Keep everything in-memory

No:

* Validation libraries
* Authentication
* Database
* External dependencies beyond express and cors

---

# Submission Requirements (Mandatory)

Each student must submit:

1. GitHub Repository Link

   * Clean structure
   * README with all routes listed
   * Steps to run locally

2. Postman Documentation Link

   * All 7 routes documented
   * Sample request and response
   * Proper status codes shown

3. Render Deployment Link

   * Public API
   * All routes working
   * No localhost references
