# Assignment 1

## Student CGPA API (Using In-Memory JSON Database)

---

## Objective

Build a REST API using **Express.js** that manages student CGPA records stored in an in-memory JSON array.

The application must:

* Use only GET routes (for this assignment)
* Include static routes and dynamic routes
* Follow REST principles
* Return proper HTTP status codes

No database is required.
Data must be stored in a JSON array inside the project.

---

## Problem Statement

Create an API that manages student academic performance records.

Each student record must contain:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Aditya",
  branch: "CSE",
  semester: 6,
  cgpa: 8.4
}
```

You must create **at least 6 GET routes**:

* 4 normal GET routes
* 2 dynamic GET routes

---

## Required Routes

### 1. GET `/students`

Return all students.

Expected Behavior:

* Status Code: 200
* Returns full JSON array

---

### 2. GET `/students/topper`

Return the student with the highest CGPA.

Expected Behavior:

* Status Code: 200
* Return only one student object
* If no students exist → return 404

Core Concept Tested:

* Array sorting or `reduce` logic

---

### 3. GET `/students/average`

Return average CGPA of all students.

Expected Response Format:

```js
{
  averageCGPA: 8.12
}
```

Core Concept Tested:

* Aggregation logic
* Data transformation

---

### 4. GET `/students/count`

Return total number of students.

Expected Response:

```js
{
  totalStudents: 10
}
```

Core Concept Tested:

* Basic array operations

---

## Dynamic Routes (Mandatory)

### 5. GET `/students/:id`

Return student by ID.

Example:

```
GET /students/3
```

Expected Behavior:

* If student exists → return student object
* If not → return 404 with message

Core Concept Tested:

* Route parameters
* `req.params`
* Proper error handling

---

### 6. GET `/students/branch/:branchName`

Return all students from a specific branch.

Example:

```
GET /students/branch/CSE
```

Expected Behavior:

* Return array of matching students
* If none found → return empty array or 404 (student must justify choice in comments)

Core Concept Tested:

* Filtering
* Case sensitivity handling
* Clean route design

---

## Technical Requirements

Students must:

* Use Express
* Use `express.json()`
* Use CORS middleware
* Maintain proper middleware order
* Use correct HTTP status codes
* Avoid blocking code

---

## Sample JSON Data (Minimum 8 Records Required)

```js
const students = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Aarav Sharma",
    branch: "CSE",
    semester: 8,
    cgpa: 9.3
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Ishita Verma",
    branch: "IT",
    semester: 7,
    cgpa: 8.9
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Rohan Kulkarni",
    branch: "ECE",
    semester: 6,
    cgpa: 8.4
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "Meera Iyer",
    branch: "CSE",
    semester: 8,
    cgpa: 9.1
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    name: "Kunal Deshmukh",
    branch: "IT",
    semester: 5,
    cgpa: 7.8
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    name: "Ananya Reddy",
    branch: "CSE",
    semester: 6,
    cgpa: 8.7
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    name: "Vikram Patil",
    branch: "ECE",
    semester: 7,
    cgpa: 8.2
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    name: "Priyanka Nair",
    branch: "AI",
    semester: 4,
    cgpa: 8.8
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    name: "Harsh Mehta",
    branch: "Data Science",
    semester: 5,
    cgpa: 8.0
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    name: "Neha Gupta",
    branch: "CSE",
    semester: 6,
    cgpa: 7.9
  }
];
```

# Submission Requirements (Mandatory)

Each student must submit **all three links** below.
Assignments without deployment or documentation will not be evaluated.

---

## 1. GitHub Repository Link

Students must:

* Push complete project to GitHub
* Include `package.json`
* Include `.gitignore`
* Include a properly written `README.md`

### README must contain:

* Project title
* Objective
* List of implemented routes
* Sample API URLs
* Steps to run locally
* Deployed link

Repository should follow clean structure and meaningful commits.

---

## 2. Postman Documentation Link

Students must:

* Create a Postman Collection
* Add all 6 required routes
* Include request method and URL
* Include sample responses
* Include expected status codes
* Publish documentation

A public Postman documentation link must be submitted.

---

## 3. Deployed API Link (Render)

Students must:

* Deploy the API on Render
* Ensure the API is publicly accessible
* Ensure all routes work correctly
* Avoid using hardcoded localhost in production

Example format:

```
GitHub Repo:
https://github.com/username/student-cgpa-api

Postman Documentation:
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/xxxxxx

Render Deployment:
https://student-cgpa-api.onrender.com
```

# Learning Outcomes

After completing this assignment, students will:

* Design RESTful GET routes
* Handle dynamic route parameters
* Perform server-side filtering and aggregation
* Return structured JSON responses
