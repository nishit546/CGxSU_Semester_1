# Assignment 5: **Recipe Book (Lists Practice)**

**Objective:**
Practice **all list types** in HTML:

* Ordered list `<ol>`
* Unordered list `<ul>`
* Nested lists (lists inside lists)
* Definition list `<dl>` with `<dt>` and `<dd>`

---

**Problem Statement:**
Create a page `recipes.html` that acts like a **Recipe Book**. It should contain **at least 3 different recipes** (e.g., Masala Dosa, Paneer Butter Masala, Gulab Jamun).

### Requirements:

1. **Page Setup:**

   * Title in `<title>`: “My Recipe Book”.
   * A main heading `<h1>`: “My Recipe Book”.
   * A short introduction paragraph about cooking.

2. **Each Recipe Must Contain:**

   * A **heading** with the recipe name.
   * A **short description** paragraph.
   * **Ingredients section** using an **unordered list** `<ul>`.
   * **Cooking steps section** using an **ordered list** `<ol>`.
   * At least **one nested list** (for example, alternatives for an ingredient inside ingredients list).
   * A **definition list** `<dl>` for cooking terms used in the recipe (e.g., sauté, simmer, garnish).

3. **Separation:**

   * Use `<hr>` between each recipe.

4. **Navigation:**

   * At the top, provide a list of links that scroll to each recipe section using anchors (`<a href="#paneer">`).
   * At the bottom, provide a “Back to Top” link.
