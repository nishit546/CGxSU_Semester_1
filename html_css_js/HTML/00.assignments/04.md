# Assignment 4: **Formatting Elements Article**

**Objective:**
Practice **all text formatting tags** in HTML by writing a long article. Students should understand the difference between visual formatting (`<b>, <i>, <u>`) and semantic formatting (`<strong>, <em>, <mark>`, etc.).

---

**Problem Statement:**
Create a page `article.html` that presents a **detailed article** on the topic:
**“The History of Computers and the Internet”**

The article must:

1. **Page Setup**

   * Title in `<title>`: “History of Computers and the Internet”.
   * Main heading `<h1>` with the article title.
   * Subheadings `<h2>` for different sections (e.g., "Early Computers", "Generations of Computers", "Birth of the Internet", "Modern Era").

2. **Text Formatting Requirements:**
   Use at least **30 different text formatting instances**, covering:

   * `<b>, <i>, <u>` (basic formatting)
   * `<strong>, <em>, <mark>` (semantic emphasis)
   * `<small>, <sup>, <sub>` (text variations)
   * `<del>, <ins>` (revisions)
   * `<abbr>` (abbreviations)
   * `<q>, <blockquote>, <cite>` (quotations & references)
   * `<code>, <kbd>, <samp>, <var>` (computer/technical text)

3. **Content Structure:**

   * At least **5 long paragraphs** (minimum 6–8 sentences each).
   * A **blockquote** with a famous quote about technology.
   * At least **3 abbreviations** (e.g., HTML, CPU, WWW).
   * A few **mathematical formulas** using `<sup>` and `<sub>` (e.g., E = mc<sup>2</sup>).
   * A **small section with computer code** using `<code>` or `<pre>`.

4. **Separators & Line Breaks:**

   * Use `<hr>` between sections.
   * Use `<br>` only when appropriate (like for breaking addresses or poetry).

        The History of Computers and the Internet (H1)
-------------------------------------------------

Early Computers (H2)
The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b>
such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the 
<u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept 
of a programmable computer</strong>.

Generations of Computers (H2)
The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has 
evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, 
while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.
By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal 
and affordable</em>.

Mathematics in Computing
A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>
Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.

Birth of the Internet (H2)
The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by
Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
<blockquote>
   "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
   Access by everyone regardless of disability is 
   an essential aspect." 
   – <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
</blockquote>

Modern Era (H2)
Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and 
fiber connections. Computers now fit in our 
<small>pockets as smartphones</small>.

Computer Example (H2)
To display text on a webpage, you can use:
<pre>
<code>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </body>
</html>
</code>
</pre>

Another example: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text.
System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>

**Hints / Constraints:**

* Must use **at least 30 formatting instances** across the page.
* Ensure a clear separation of sections with `<hr>`.
* Make it look like a real article (not just random formatting).
* No CSS allowed.
