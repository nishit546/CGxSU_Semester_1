# Assignment 2: **Travel Blog (Multi-Page Linking)**

**Objective:**
Practice **multiple HTML files**, hyperlinks, headings, paragraphs, and images. Learn how to **connect multiple pages together** to form a small website using only HTML.

---

**Problem Statement:**
You need to create a **Travel Blog Website** using only HTML. The blog should contain **one main page (`index.html`)** and at least **3 travel destination pages** (for example: `delhi.html`, `mumbai.html`, `jaipur.html`).

### Requirements:

1. **Main Page (`index.html`):**

   * Title: “My Travel Blog” (inside `<title>`).
   * A main heading `<h1>` with the blog name.
   * A short introductory paragraph about your love for traveling.
   * A list of **links** (using `<a>`) to each of your destination pages.
   * A “Contact Me” link that leads to an empty `contact.html` page.

2. **Destination Pages (`delhi.html`, `mumbai.html`, `jaipur.html`):**

   * Each page must have:

     * A **heading** with the city name.
     * At least **3 paragraphs** describing that city.
     * At least **1 image** (`<img>`) of that city (you can use placeholder image links).
     * A **link back to the Home Page**.
     * A **link to the next city’s page** (like a chain).

3. **Contact Page (`contact.html`):**

   * Heading: “Contact Me”
   * A paragraph asking readers to get in touch (no form yet, only text).
   * A link back to the Home Page.
