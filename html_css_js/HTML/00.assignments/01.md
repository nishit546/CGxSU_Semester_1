# Assignment 1: **Personal Bio Page**

**Objective:** Practice headings, paragraphs, line breaks, and basic text formatting tags.

**Problem Statement:**
Create a single-page HTML document named `bio.html` that introduces yourself. Your page should include:

* A **main heading** (your name in `<h1>`).
* A **subheading** (short tagline like "Aspiring Web Developer" in `<h2>`).
* At least **3 paragraphs**:

  1. Introduction (who you are).
  2. Hobbies and interests.
  3. Future goals.
* Use formatting tags (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<mark>`, `<sup>`, `<sub>`).
* Insert **horizontal rules** (`<hr>`) between sections.
* Add **line breaks** where needed (`<br>`).

**Sample Output (Visual Layout Description):**

```

                 [Your Name] (big heading)

          Aspiring Web Developer (smaller heading)

**Hints / Constraints:**
