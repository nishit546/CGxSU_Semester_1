---

**Assignment Instructions:**

1. **Choose the live page:**
   Use this URL: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual\_funds\_in\_India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India)

2. **Clone the following elements in HTML:**

   * **Page Title & Heading**:

     * Set `<title>` to **"Wikipedia — Mutual funds in India"** (or similar).
     * Use `<h1>` to display the article’s title.

   * **Table of Contents (TOC):**

     * Recreate the full Table of Contents with internal anchor links corresponding to each section and sub-section.
     * Example: `[1. Mutual fund statistics]`, `[2. Mutual fund category breakup]`, `[3. Controversies]`, with sub-headings like “3.1.1 Franklin Templeton…” etc. ([Wikipedia][1])

   * **Sections & Headings:**

     * Use headings: `<h2>` for each major section (e.g., Mutual fund statistics, Category breakup, Controversies).
     * Use `<h3>` or `<h4>` for nested subsections (e.g., “3.1.1 Franklin Templeton fiasco”, etc.) ([Wikipedia][2])

   * **Content & Formatting:**

     * Copy over the paragraphs, statistics, and narrative.
     * Replicate inline elements like `<sup>`, `<abbr>`, emphasis (`<em>`, `<strong>`), and links.
     * For example:

       * Use `<abbr>` for abbreviations and their expansion.
       * Use `<sup>` in the text where footnote markers appear.
       * Maintain internal links to other Wikipedia pages and external links as in the original.

   * **Tables:**

     * Recreate any table from the original page—e.g., “Mutual Fund Acquisitions” table listing "Seller | Acquired By | Year".
     * Structure with `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`. Use `<caption>` where appropriate. ([Wikipedia][1])

   * **Lists:**

     * Implement unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered (`<ol>`) lists for sections like assets under management statistics and acquisitions. ([Wikipedia][1])

   * **Images:**

     * If the article contains images (like logos, charts), embed them using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`, with appropriate `alt` and `title` attributes.
     * If actual images aren’t necessary, use placeholders like `alt="Placeholder image"`.

   * **References Section:**

     * Create a “References” section at the end, using `<ol>` to list at least 10 individual reference citations.
     * Use `<sup>[1]</sup>` in the content to link each cite back to the reference in the list. ([Wikipedia][1])

   * **Navigation & Semantics:**

     * Use semantic containers—`<nav>` (for TOC), `<main>` for content, `<footer>` with proper links.
     * Maintain file naming consistency (e.g., `mutual_funds_in_india_clone.html`).
