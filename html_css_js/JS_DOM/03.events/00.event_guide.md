# JavaScript Events – 

JavaScript events are **signals** that something happened in the browser:

* The user clicked a button.
* A key was pressed.
* A form was submitted.
* The page finished loading.
* The window was resized.

You “listen” for these events and then run some code in response.

Below are the most commonly used event types, grouped by category, with a simple explanation of what each one does.

---

## 1. Mouse Events

These events are triggered when the user uses a mouse or a trackpad.

* **`click`**
  Fires when the user presses and releases the primary mouse button (usually left-click) on an element.
  Used for: buttons, links, toggles, starting actions.

* **`dblclick`**
  Fires when the user quickly clicks an element twice.
  Used for: special actions like “open in edit mode”, zoom, or advanced UI behaviours.

* **`mousedown`**
  Fires as soon as the mouse button is pressed down on an element (before it is released).
  Used for: drawing tools, dragging start, visual feedback while pressing (e.g., button press effect).

* **`mouseup`**
  Fires when the mouse button is released after being pressed.
  Used for: detecting the end of a drag, completing custom click logic.

* **`mouseenter`**
  Fires when the mouse pointer enters the area of an element.
  Does **not** bubble up (stays on that element).
  Used for: hover effects, showing tooltips, highlighting cards.

* **`mouseleave`**
  Fires when the mouse pointer leaves the area of an element.
  Does **not** bubble.
  Used for: removing hover effect, hiding tooltips.

* **`mouseover`**
  Fires when the mouse pointer moves **onto** an element or any of its children.
  Bubbles up.
  Used for: detailed hover behaviour where children matter.

* **`mouseout`**
  Fires when the mouse pointer moves **out of** an element or any of its children.
  Bubbles up.
  Used for: more complex hover/leave behaviour.

* **`mousemove`**
  Fires every time the mouse moves over an element (many times per second).
  Used for: tracking pointer position, drawing on canvas, custom cursor effects.

* **`contextmenu`**
  Usually fires on right-click (or long-press on touch).
  Used for: showing custom right-click menus, preventing the default context menu.

* **`wheel`**
  Fires when the user spins the mouse wheel or uses a trackpad scroll gesture over an element.
  Used for: custom scroll effects, zooming, detecting scroll direction (up/down).

---

## 2. Keyboard Events

These events react to keyboard actions.

* **`keydown`**
  Fires when a key is pressed down (before it is released).
  Used for: shortcuts (Ctrl+S), game controls, reacting immediately to key press.

* **`keyup`**
  Fires when a pressed key is released.
  Used for: finalizing input, detecting “key finished”, shortcuts that should trigger on release.

* **`keypress`** (older / not recommended for new code)
  Historically fired when a key producing a character was pressed.
  Now mostly replaced by `keydown` / `keyup` and not recommended for new projects.

## 3. Form & Input Events

These events are related to text fields, forms, and user input.

* **`input`**
  Fires whenever the value of an input or textarea changes (typing, deleting, pasting).
  Used for: live search, character counters, live preview.

* **`change`**
  Fires when an input’s value is **committed** (e.g., user leaves the field) or a selection changes in a dropdown.
  Used for: reacting to final value of fields, dropdown selections, checkbox/radio changes.

* **`submit`**
  Fires when a form is submitted (for example, clicking a submit button or pressing Enter in a field).
  Used for: handling form data, preventing default page reload, validating inputs.

* **`reset`**
  Fires when a form is reset to its initial values.
  Used for: reacting to form resets, clearing extra UI state.

* **`invalid`**
  Fires when a form field fails HTML5 validation (like required fields or pattern mismatch).
  Used for: custom error messages and visual indicators.

* **`select`**
  Fires when the user selects text inside an `<input>` or `<textarea>`.
  Used for: showing formatting options, tooltips, or copy helpers.

---

## 4. Focus & Blur Events

These deal with which element is currently “active” for user input.

* **`focus`**
  Fires when an element (like an input) gains focus.
  Used for: highlighting active input, showing hints, opening related UI.

* **`blur`**
  Fires when an element loses focus (user clicks away or tabs out).
  Used for: validating fields when user leaves them, hiding hints, saving partial values.

* **`focusin`** / **`focusout`**
  Similar to `focus` / `blur` but they **bubble** (move up the DOM tree).
  Used for: tracking focus changes on parent elements, form-wide focus management.

---

## 5. Window & Document Events

These are related to the overall page and browser window.

* **`load`** (on `window`)
  Fires when the entire page has fully loaded, including images, styles, and sub-resources.
  Used for: starting scripts that depend on everything being ready.

* **`DOMContentLoaded`** (on `document`)
  Fires when the HTML is fully loaded and parsed, but before images and other resources finish loading.
  Used for: setting up event listeners and basic DOM logic as soon as elements exist.

* **`resize`** (on `window`)
  Fires when the browser window size changes.
  Used for: responsive adjustments, recalculating layouts, updating size-related text.

* **`scroll`**
  Fires when the user scrolls a page or a specific scrollable element.
  Used for: sticky headers, infinite scroll, scroll progress indicators, lazy loading.

* **`beforeunload`**
  Fires when the user is about to leave the page (navigate away, close tab).
  Modern browsers limit what you can do here.
  Used for: warning about unsaved work (with restrictions).

## 6. Clipboard Events

These events are about copying, cutting, and pasting.

* **`copy`**
  Fires when the user copies content (Ctrl+C or context menu Copy).
  Used for: analytics, showing “Copied!” messages, customizing copy behaviour.

* **`cut`**
  Fires when the user cuts content (Ctrl+X).
  Used for: similar reasons as `copy`, but for cutting.

* **`paste`**
  Fires when the user pastes content (Ctrl+V).
  Used for: cleaning pasted text, reacting to incoming data, security checks.

## 7. Drag & Drop Events

These come into play when dragging elements around.

* **`dragstart`**
  Fires when the user starts dragging an element.
  Used for: marking the dragged item, setting drag data.

* **`drag`**
  Fires continuously while the element is being dragged.
  Used for: following cursor, live feedback.

* **`dragend`**
  Fires when the dragging stops (whether drop happened or not).
  Used for: cleaning up visual state.

* **`dragenter`**
  Fires when a dragged element enters a drop target.
  Used for: highlighting valid drop zones.

* **`dragover`**
  Fires while a dragged element is over a drop target.
  Often used with `preventDefault()` to allow dropping.

* **`dragleave`**
  Fires when a dragged element leaves a drop target.
  Used for: removing highlight from drop zone.

* **`drop`**
  Fires when the dragged element is actually dropped onto a drop target.
  Used for: final action – move item, upload files, reorder list.

## 8. Touch Events (Mobile / Tablets)

These are used on touch screens.

* **`touchstart`**
  Fires when a finger touches the screen.
  Equivalent to mouse `mousedown` for touch.

* **`touchmove`**

  Equivalent to mouse `mousemove`.

* **`touchend`**
  Fires when the finger is lifted from the screen.
  Equivalent to mouse `mouseup`.

* **`touchcancel`**
  Fires when the system cancels a touch event (for example, an incoming call interrupts).

These are useful for mobile-specific gestures like swipes, pinch zoom, etc.

## 11. Other Useful Events to Know About

A few more that come up in real projects:

* **`error`**
  On images, scripts, or the window – fires when a resource fails to load.
  Used for: fallback images, error reporting.

* **`hashchange`**
  Fires when the URL hash part (`#something`) changes.
  Used for: simple client-side routing without heavy frameworks.

* **`online` / `offline`**
  On `window` – fired when the browser goes online or offline.

## Important Note

* You don’t need to memorize every single event.
  Focus on the **core ones** first:

  * `click`, `input`, `change`, `submit`, `focus`, `blur`,
  * `keydown`, `scroll`, `load`, `resize`.

* The **pattern** is always the same:

  1. Select an element.
  2. Listen for an event on that element (or window/document).
  3. Write code that runs when the event happens.

* Different elements are more “natural” for different events:

  * Buttons → `click`
  * Forms → `submit`
  * Inputs → `input`, `change`, `focus`, `blur`
  * Window → `scroll`, `resize`, `load`
  * Document → `DOMContentLoaded`, `keydown`
