## Exercise 1: Change Text on Button Click

### Goal

* There is a paragraph with some text.
* When we click a button, we change the text of that paragraph.

Very basic: select element → listen to click → change `textContent`.

---

## Exercise 2: Change Color / Style of an Element

### Goal

* There is a paragraph with some text.
* When we click a button, we change its color, background, and font size.

Again: select element → click → change `style` properties.

---

## Exercise 3: Show and Hide a Paragraph (Toggle)

### Goal

* There is a paragraph on the page.
* There is a button that starts with text: “Hide”.
* When we click:

  * If the paragraph is visible → hide it and change button text to “Show”.
  * If the paragraph is hidden → show it and change button text to “Hide”.

This teaches: selecting elements, checking a condition, changing `style.display`.

---

## Exercise 4: Counter Button

### Goal

* Show a number on the page, starting from 0.
* Have a button “Increase”.
* Every time we click the button, the number increases by 1.

This teaches: DOM selection, updating text from a variable.

---

## Exercise 5: Change Image Source

### Goal

* Show one image on the page.
* Have two buttons: “Show Image 1” and “Show Image 2”.
* When we click a button, the image changes.

This teaches: selecting an `<img>` element and changing its `src` attribute.

---

## Exercise 6: Add New List Item

### Goal

* Have an empty list (`<ul>`).
* Have a text input and a button “Add Item”.
* When we type something and click the button, a new `<li>` is added to the list with that text.

This teaches: `getElementById`, reading `input.value`, `createElement`, `appendChild`.

---

## Exercise 7: Clear All List Items

We’ll continue from the previous todo list idea.

### Goal

* Keep the same `<ul>` list and “Add Item” feature.
* Add a new button “Clear List”.
* When we click “Clear List”, remove all `<li>` items from the list.

This teaches: manipulating the whole list via `innerHTML = ""` (simple) or removing children.

---

## Exercise 8: Change Background Color of Page

### Goal

* Have three buttons: “Red”, “Green”, “Blue”.
* When we click a button, change the **page background color** to that color.

This teaches: selecting buttons, adding click events, and using `document.body.style`.
