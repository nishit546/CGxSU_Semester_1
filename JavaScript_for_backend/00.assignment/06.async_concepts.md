# **JavaScript Async Concepts**

**Instructions for Students**

* Answer all questions **in your own words**
* Write all answers in a notebook using a pen.
* Code outputs must be written clearly step-by-step

---

## **Section A – Core Understanding (Short Answers)**

1. What is the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** JavaScript?

2. Why does JavaScript need asynchronous behavior even though it is **single-threaded**?

3. What is the **Call Stack**?
   What kind of tasks go into the call stack?

4. What is the difference between:

   * `setTimeout`
   * `setInterval`

6. Does `setTimeout(fn, 0)` execute immediately?
   Explain **why or why not**.

---

## **Section B – Event Loop & Queues**

7. What is the **Event Loop**?
   Explain its role in one paragraph.

8. What is the difference between:

   * **Macro Task Queue**
   * **Micro Task Queue**

9. List at least **3 examples** of:

   * Macro tasks
   * Micro tasks

10. Which gets executed first and why:

* `setTimeout`
* `Promise.then()`

---

## **Section C – Code Reading & Output Prediction**

### **Question 11**

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

* Write the **exact output order**
* Explain the reason in 2–3 lines

---

### **Question 12**

```js
console.log("A");

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("B");
});

console.log("C");
```

* Write the output
* Mention which queue is used for `Promise.then`

---

### **Question 13**

```js
console.log("1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2");
}, 100);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("3");
});

console.log("4");
```

* Write the output sequence
* Explain the priority order involved

---

## **Section D – Callbacks & Problems**

14. What is a **callback function**?
    Write one real-world example (not code).

15. Why were callbacks introduced in JavaScript?

16. What is **callback hell**?
    Write two problems caused by callback hell.

---

## **Section E – Promises (Conceptual)**

17. What is a **Promise** in JavaScript?

18. List and explain the **three states of a Promise**.

19. What is the difference between:

* `.then()`
* `.catch()`
* `.finally()`

20. Why are Promises considered better than callbacks?

---

## **Section F – Promise Utilities (Theory Only)**

21. Explain `Promise.all()`:

* When does it resolve?
* When does it reject?

22. Explain `Promise.race()` in simple terms.

23. Explain `Promise.allSettled()` and one use case.

---

## **Section G – Real-World Thinking**

24. Consider this scenario:

> You are fetching **user data**, **orders**, and **payments** from three APIs.

* Which Promise method would you use?
* Why?
