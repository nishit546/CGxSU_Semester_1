# **Classes in JavaScript (ES6)**

# **1. What Is a Class?**

A **class** is a **blueprint** for creating objects.

* An object = data (properties) + actions (methods)
* A class describes **what properties every object will have**
* And **what actions every object can perform**

### Real-life example

A **Student** class can describe:

* name
* age
* course
* methods like introduce(), getDetails(), etc.

From this single class, we can create many student objects.

---

# **2. Why Do We Need Classes?**

Without classes, every student object would look like this:

```javascript
var s1 = {
    name: "Krishna",
    age: 18,
    branch: "CSE"
};

var s2 = {
    name: "Arjun",
    age: 19,
    branch: "IT"
};
```

This is OK for 2 students…
But not OK for 200 students.

**Classes solve this problem by giving a single blueprint.**

---

# **3. Creating Your First Class**

```javascript
class Student {

}
```

This creates a class named **Student**.

It doesn't do anything yet — but that's fine.

Next step is to create an object from it.

---

# **4. Creating Objects Using a Class**

Use the `new` keyword:

```javascript
var s1 = new Student();
console.log(s1);
```

At this point, the object is empty because we haven't defined any properties.

---

# **5. Adding a Constructor**

`constructor()` is a special method that runs **automatically** whenever a new object is created.

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, age, branch) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.branch = branch;
    }
}

var s1 = new Student("Krishna", 18, "CSE");
console.log(s1);
```

### Explanation:

* `this.name` → property
* `"Krishna"` → value received
* Every new Student object will now have these properties

---

# **6. Adding Methods to a Class**

Methods describe **actions** the object can perform.

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, age, branch) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.branch = branch;
    }

    introduce() {
        console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} from ${this.branch}`);
    }
}

var s1 = new Student("Mahir", 19, "CSE");
s1.introduce();
```

---

# **7. Adding More Methods (Behavior)**

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, marks) {
        this.name = name;
        this.marks = marks;
    }

    getResult() {
        if (this.marks >= 35) {
            return "Pass";
        }
        return "Fail";
    }
}

var s = new Student("Arjun", 82);
console.log(s.getResult()); // Pass
```

Methods make objects useful.

---

# **8. Getters and Setters (Controlled Access)**

Sometimes we don't want someone to directly modify object data without checks.

Example: Marks must be between 0 and 100.

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, marks) {
        this.name = name;
        this._marks = marks;
    }

    get marks() {
        return this._marks;
    }

    set marks(value) {
        if (value < 0 || value > 100) {
            console.log("Invalid marks");
            return;
        }
        this._marks = value;
    }
}

var s = new Student("Krishna", 90);
console.log(s.marks);

s.marks = 120; // invalid
s.marks = 95;  // valid

console.log(s.marks);
```

---

# **9. Static Methods**

Static methods belong to the **class**, not the object.

Use them for utility functions.

```javascript
class MathTools {
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

console.log(MathTools.add(10, 20)); // 30
```

Trying to call using object:

```javascript
var m = new MathTools();
m.add(); // ❌ Error
```

---

# **10. Class Summary (Everything So Far)**

A class can contain:

1. Properties (inside constructor)
2. Methods
3. Getter & Setter methods
4. Static methods

Here is a complete example:

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(name, age, branch) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.branch = branch;
    }

    introduce() {
        console.log(`${this.name}, ${this.branch}`);
    }

    get details() {
        return `${this.name} - Age ${this.age}`;
    }

    set updateName(newName) {
        this.name = newName;
    }

    static welcome() {
        return "Welcome to CodingGita!";
    }
}

var s = new Student("Jenil", 18, "CSE");

s.introduce();
console.log(s.details);
s.updateName = "Jenil Patel";
console.log(s.details);

console.log(Student.welcome());
```

---

# **11. Real Example**

A Course class:

```javascript
class Course {
    constructor(title, duration, fee) {
        this.title = title;
        this.duration = duration;
        this.fee = fee;
    }

    getInfo() {
        return `${this.title} (${this.duration}) - ₹${this.fee}`;
    }

    get discountedFee() {
        return this.fee * 0.9;   // 10% discount
    }
}

var js = new Course("JavaScript Basics", "40 hours", 5000);
console.log(js.getInfo());
console.log(js.discountedFee);
```

# **12. Common Mistakes**

### Mistake 1 — Forgetting `new`

```javascript
var s = Student("Krishna", 18);  // ❌ Wrong
```

Always use:

```javascript
var s = new Student("Krishna", 18);  // ✔️ Correct
```

---

### Mistake 2 — Using `this` before constructor runs

Inside methods, `this` always refers to the object.

---

### Mistake 3 — Confusing static and instance methods

```javascript
Student.welcome(); // ✔️
new Student().welcome(); // ❌ error
```

---

# **13. Exercises**

### Exercise 1

Create a `Book` class with properties:

* title
* author
* price

Add a method `getDetails()`.

---

### Exercise 2

Create a class `Employee` with getter & setter for salary:

* Salary cannot be negative
* Salary cannot exceed ₹2,00,000

---

### Exercise 3

Create a class `CGMath` with static functions:

* add
* subtract
* multiply

# **14. MCQ Questions**

Q1. Which keyword creates an object?

---

Q3. Which method belongs to the class, not to an object?
A) instance method
B) static method
C) getter
D) setter

**Answer: B**

---

# **15. Mini Assignment**

Create a class:

```javascript
class CGStudent
```

It must have:

* name
* branch
* marks
* method: printInfo()
* setter for marks (must be 0–100)
* static method: compareTwo(s1, s2) → return student with higher marks

Create 2 students and compare them.
