# Error Handling and Debugging in JavaScript

Every programmer makes mistakes — even experienced developers.
Errors are a normal part of writing code.
The important part is knowing **how to find**, **understand**, and **fix** them.

This article teaches:

* Types of errors
* Reading error messages
* Using console tools
* Debugging techniques
* try–catch 

---

# 1. What Is an Error?

An **error** is something that stops your JavaScript code from running correctly.

### Example:

```javascript
console.log(studentName);
```

If `studentName` is not defined, JavaScript throws an error.

---

# 2. Types of Errors

There are three major types:

---

## 1. Syntax Error

Mistakes in code structure (like grammar errors).

Examples:

```javascript
var x = ;     // missing value
console.log("Hello"   // missing )
```

JavaScript cannot even start running when syntax is wrong.

---

## 2. Runtime Error

Errors that occur **while** the program is running.

Example:

```javascript
var a = 10;
console.log(b);  // b is not defined
```

---

## 3. Logical Error

Code runs, but gives **wrong output**.

Example:

```javascript
var marks = [80, 90, 100];
console.log(marks.length - 1);  // wrong: prints 2 instead of total marks
```

These are the hardest to catch.

---

# 3. Reading Error Messages (Very Important)

Beginners often ignore error messages.

Example:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: student is not defined
    at script.js:2
```

Meaning:

* Type of error → ReferenceError
* What happened → “student” does not exist
* Where → script.js at line 2

Students must develop the habit of **reading errors line by line**.

---

# 4. Using console.log() for Debugging

This is the simplest debugging technique.

### Example:

```javascript
var total = marks1 + marks2 + marks3;
console.log("Total is:", total);
```

Console logs help you:

* check variable values
* check flow of code
* identify mistakes early

---

# 5. Debugging with Browser DevTools

Open Chrome:

* Press **F12** → Console tab
* You can see:

  * errors
  * warnings
  * console logs
  * variable values

### Example:

Try this in console:

```javascript
console.log("Testing...");
```

---

# 6. breakpoints 

Students can click the **line number** in the Sources tab to pause code at that line.

This helps them:

* inspect variables
* understand the flow
* find wrong values

---

# 7. try–catch 

try–catch lets you handle errors **without stopping the entire program**.

### Syntax:

```javascript
try {
    // code that might produce an error
} catch (error) {
    // handle the error
}
```

---

### Example:

```javascript
try {
    console.log(studentName);
} catch (e) {
    console.log("An error occurred.");
    console.log("Error message:", e.message);
}
```

Output:

```
An error occurred.
Error message: studentName is not defined
```

The code does not crash.

---

# 8. try–catch for User Input

```javascript
try {
    var marks = parseInt("ABC");  // invalid number
    if (isNaN(marks)) {
        throw "Invalid marks";
    }
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Error:", error);
}
```

---

# 9. throw (Creating Custom Errors)

You can throw your own error message.

```javascript
var age = 15;

try {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw "Underage student";
    }
} catch (err) {
    console.log("Error:", err);
}
```

---

# 10. Common Errors Beginners Make

1. **Misspelling variable names**

```javascript
var studentName = "Jenil";
console.log(studentname); // wrong
```

2. **Missing brackets or quotes**

```javascript
if (x > 10 {
```

3. **Using variables before declaring them**

```javascript
console.log(a);
var a = 10;
```

4. **Wrong data types**

```javascript
var age = "18";
console.log(age + 2); // Produces "182"
```

5. **Accessing array element out of range**

```javascript
var arr = [10, 20];
console.log(arr[5]); // undefined
```

---

# 11. Debugging Logical Errors

Logical errors give wrong output, and require thinking.

### Example:

```javascript
var total = 0;
var marks = [80, 90, 70];

for (var i = 1; i <= marks.length; i++) {   // problem: starts at 1
    total += marks[i];
}
console.log(total);
```

Correct:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < marks.length; i++) {
```

---

# 12. Debugging Strategy

### Step 1:

Find the **line number** of the error.

### Step 2:

Read the **error type**:

* ReferenceError
* TypeError
* SyntaxError
* RangeError

### Step 3:

Add console.log to check values.

### Step 4:

Fix logical issues one step at a time.

### Step 5:

Re-run until the code is stable.

# 13. Real Example

A student's average program throws error:

```javascript
var student = {
    name: "Krishna",
    marks: [80, 90, 85],
    avg: function() {
        return this.marks[0] + this.marks[1] + this.marks[2] / 3;
    }
};

console.log(student.avg());
```

Bug: Missing parentheses.

Correct:

```javascript
return (this.marks[0] + this.marks[1] + this.marks[2]) / 3;
```

---

# 14. Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1

Fix the error:

```javascript
console.log(studentName;
```

---

### Exercise 2

Use try–catch to handle undefined variable.

---

### Exercise 3

Debug the program:

```javascript
var a = 10;
var b = "20";
console.log(a + b);
```

---

### Exercise 4

Correct the loop:

```javascript
for (var i = 1; i <= arr.length; i++)
```

---

### Exercise 5

Write a try–catch that throws an error if marks > 100.

---

# 16. Mini Assignment

Create a program to calculate average marks for five CodingGita students.

Your program must include:

1. An array of 5 marks
2. A try–catch block
3. Throw an error if:

   * mark < 0
   * mark > 100
   * mark is not a number

Example expected output:

```
Error: Invalid marks at index 3
```

This assignment teaches:

* validation
* debugging
* try–catch
* careful coding
