# **10: Set Data Structure**

## What Is a Set

A Set is a **data structure that stores unique values**.

* Each value appears **only once**
* Order is not the main concern
* Duplicate entries are automatically ignored

A Set answers one simple question efficiently:

> “Is this value already present?”

## Visualizing a Set

Even if the same value is added multiple times, it exists only once in the Set.

---

## Set in JavaScript

JavaScript provides a built-in `Set` type.

```js
const ids = new Set();

ids.add(1);
ids.add(2);
ids.add(1); // duplicate
```

The Set now contains:

```
1, 2
```

The duplicate value is ignored automatically.

---

## Core Operations on Set

### Adding Values

```js
ids.add(3);
```

---

### Checking for Existence

```js
ids.has(2); // true
ids.has(5); // false
```

---

### Removing Values

```js
ids.delete(1);
```

---

### Size of a Set

```js
ids.size;
```

---

## Why Sets Are Useful

Sets are chosen when:

* Uniqueness matters
* Fast existence checks are required
* Duplicate handling should be automatic

Using arrays for the same purpose would require:

* Manual checks
* Extra loops
* More error-prone logic

---

## Set vs Array (Practical Comparison)

| Requirement         | Array | Set |
| ------------------- | ----- | --- |
| Allow duplicates    | Yes   | No  |
| Fast lookup         | No    | Yes |
| Order important     | Yes   | No  |
| Uniqueness enforced | No    | Yes |

Both are useful, but for **unique collections**, Set is the better choice.

---

## Common Uses of Set in JavaScript

### 1. Removing Duplicates

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4];
const uniqueNumbers = new Set(numbers);
```

---

### 2. Tracking Unique Items

```js
const visitedPages = new Set();

visitedPages.add("home");
visitedPages.add("about");
```

Each page is recorded only once.

---

## Set and Async JavaScript (Where It Fits)

In async systems, Sets are often used to:

* Track active operations
* Avoid duplicate async calls
* Manage registered listeners

Example (conceptual):

```js
const activeRequests = new Set();

activeRequests.add(requestId);
// request runs
activeRequests.delete(requestId);
```

This ensures:

* Each request is tracked once
* Cleanup is simple and safe

---

## Set vs Map (Quick Distinction)

* **Set** → stores only values
* **Map** → stores key–value pairs

Use a Set when:

* Only uniqueness matters
* No associated value is required

---

## Key Characteristics

* Stores unique values only
* Fast add, delete, and lookup
* Simple API
* Widely used in real JavaScript code

---

## Summary

* Set is a data structure for unique values
* JavaScript provides a built-in `Set`
* Prevents duplicates automatically
* Useful for tracking, filtering, and async coordination
* Chosen when uniqueness is more important than order
