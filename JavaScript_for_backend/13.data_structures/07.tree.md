# **7: Tree Data Structure**

## What Is a Tree

A tree is a **non-linear data structure** used to represent **hierarchical relationships**.

* It starts from a **root**
* Data flows downward to **children**
* Each node can have multiple child nodes

Trees are used when data has **levels** instead of a straight sequence.

---

## Basic Tree Terminology

* **Root** – the topmost node
* **Parent** – a node that has children
* **Child** – a node connected below another node
* **Leaf** – a node with no children
* **Level / Depth** – position of a node in the hierarchy

## Visualizing a Tree

This shape is what makes trees different from arrays or linked lists.

---

## Simple Tree Example

```
        Root
       /    \
    Node1  Node2
     /
  Node3
```

* `Root` is the entry point
* `Node1` and `Node2` are children
* `Node3` is a deeper-level child

There is **one clear hierarchy**.

## Tree vs Linear Data Structures

| Structure   | Shape        | Best For             |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Array       | Linear       | Ordered data         |
| Linked List | Linear       | Sequential access    |
| Tree        | Hierarchical | Nested relationships |

Trees are chosen when **parent–child structure matters**.

## Trees in JavaScript (Real Usage)

### 1. DOM (Document Object Model)

HTML is represented internally as a **tree**.

Example:

```html
<body>
  <div>
    <p>Hello</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

* `<body>` is the root
* `<div>` is a child
* `<p>` is a deeper node

JavaScript traverses this tree when:

* Selecting elements
* Adding event listeners
* Updating UI

---

### 2. Folder and File Structures

```
project/
 ├── src/
 │   ├── index.js
 │   └── utils.js
 └── package.json
```

This is a **tree**, not an array.

---

## Tree Traversal (Conceptual)

Traversal means **visiting nodes** in a tree.

Common ideas (no algorithms needed):

* Top to bottom
* Parent before children
* Children before parent

JavaScript uses traversal internally when:

* Searching DOM elements
* Rendering UI trees
* Processing nested data

---

## Trees and Async JavaScript (Where It Fits)

Trees are useful in async systems when work is **structured in stages**.

Examples:

* UI rendering pipelines
* Nested API responses
* Step-by-step workflows

Example nested async data:

```js
{
  user: {
    profile: {
      preferences: {}
    }
  }
}
```

This data is naturally handled as a **tree**, even if async operations fill it gradually.

---

## Why Trees Matter for Async Thinking

* Async data often arrives **in parts**
* Each part fills a branch of a structure
* Trees help organize incomplete and complete data together

Trees do **not execute async code**, but they **shape how async data is stored and processed**.

---

## Common Types of Trees (High Level)

* **General Tree** – any number of children
* **Binary Tree** – max two children
* **N-ary Tree** – fixed number of children

For JavaScript developers, understanding the **concept** is usually enough.

---

## Summary

* Trees represent hierarchical data
* Data flows from root to leaves
* Used heavily in DOM and structured data
* Helpful for organizing async-loaded nested data
* Non-linear and level-based
