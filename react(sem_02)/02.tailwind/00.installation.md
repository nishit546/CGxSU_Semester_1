### **Tailwind CSS Installation with Vite Plugin**

This guide covers installing Tailwind CSS v4+ using the official Vite plugin, and how to integrate it with modern frameworks like React, SvelteKit, Nuxt, SolidJS, and other Vite-based projects.

---

### **Step 1: Install Tailwind CSS and Vite Plugin**

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

This installs ``Tailwind CSS v4+ `` along with the official Vite plugin, enabling a zero-config setup with no separate PostCSS or Tailwind configuration required by default.

---

### **Step 2: Configure the Vite Plugin**

Update the `vite.config.js` (or `vite.config.ts` if you're using TypeScript) file. Add the **`@tailwindcss/vite`** plugin in the `plugins` array.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(), // Enables Tailwind CSS as part of the Vite build
  ],
});
```
With Tailwind CSS v4+, this plugin handles:

- Automatic CSS processing  
- Vendor prefixing  
- Production optimizations  

No additional PostCSS or Tailwind configuration is required unless you need customization.

---

### **Step 3: Import Tailwind CSS in Your CSS File**

Create a CSS file (e.g., `src/styles.css`) and add the following:

```css
@import "tailwindcss"; /* Import all Tailwind CSS utilities */
```
With ``Tailwind CSS v4+``, this single import automatically includes all base styles, components, and utilities.

This CSS file must then be imported into your application’s main entry file (such as `main.js`, `main.jsx`, or `main.tsx`) so that Vite can process and bundle it during development and production builds.

This file will be compiled by Vite into the final output CSS.

This file will be compiled by Vite into the final output CSS.

---

### **Step 4: Add the CSS Output to Your HTML**

Vite handles the build process automatically, but ensure that the output CSS is linked in your `index.html` (or framework's main HTML file).

Here’s an example `index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link href="/dist/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">
      Hello world!
    </h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

### **Step 5: Run the Development Server**

Now you’re ready to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite server, compiles your Tailwind CSS, and hot-reloads your application on changes.

---

### **Step 6: Start Using Tailwind Utility Classes**

You can now start using Tailwind's utility classes in your application. For example:

```html
<div class="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md space-y-4">
  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Welcome to Tailwind!</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-500">Your CSS setup is now complete. 🎉</p>
</div>
```

### **Advantages of Using Vite with Tailwind CSS**
1. **Lightning-fast builds:** Vite leverages native ES modules during development and uses ESBuild/Rollup under the hood for extremely fast builds.
2. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** Tailwind utility changes are reflected instantly without a full page refresh.
3. **Framework-agnostic:** Easily integrates with React, Vue, Svelte, SolidJS, and even vanilla Vite projects.
4. **Optimized production builds:** Tailwind CSS v4+ automatically removes unused styles, and Vite efficiently bundles and optimizes the final CSS for deployment.
