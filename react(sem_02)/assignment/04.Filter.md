1. API: https://fakestoreapi.com/products

2. Store the fetched data in a state variable.

3. Implement **category-based filtering** using a dropdown:
- All
- Men's clothing
- Women's clothing
- Electronics
- Jewelery

4. Implement **price-based sorting** using another dropdown:
- Price: Low to High
- Price: High to Low

5. The filtering should be applied **before** sorting.

6. Display the following details for each product:
- Product title
- Product price

7. Ensure that:
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) are used correctly
- The original product list is not mutated while sorting
- Each rendered product has a unique `key`

---

### Expected Outcome

- On initial load, all products are displayed.
- Selecting a category filters the products accordingly.
- Selecting a sort option rearranges the products based on price.
- Filter and sort work together seamlessly.

---

### Bonus (Optional)

- Add console logs to understand how filtering and sorting work internally.
- Improve UI styling using CSS or Tailwind.
