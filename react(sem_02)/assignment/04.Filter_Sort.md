# React Assignment – Product Filter & Sort (useEffect + useState)

## Objective

To understand:

* Fetching data using **useEffect**
* Managing state using **useState**
* Filtering and sorting data
* Rendering dynamic lists

---

## Task Description

Build a **Product Listing Page** that fetches products from an API and allows users to **filter by category** and **sort by price**.

---

## API

https://fakestoreapi.com/products


---

## Requirements

### State Management

Use `useState` to manage:

* Product list
* Selected category
* Selected sort option

---

### Functional Requirements

* Fetch product data when the component mounts
* Store fetched data in state
* Add a **category filter dropdown** with options:
  * All
  * Men's Clothing
  * Women's Clothing
  * Electronics
  * Jewelery
* Add a **price sort dropdown**:
  * Low to High
  * High to Low
* Apply **filtering before sorting**
* Display for each product:
  * Product title
  * Product price

---

### Rules

* API call must run **only once**
* Do not mutate the original product array
* Use `.map()` to render the product list
* Each product must have a unique `key`
* Filtering and sorting must be dynamic

---

## Bonus

* Show loading state while fetching data
* Improve UI using CSS or Tailwind
* Add console logs to understand data flow

---

## Evaluation

* Correct use of `useEffect`
* Proper use of `useState`
* Correct filtering and sorting logic
* Clean and readable JSX
* Good component structure
